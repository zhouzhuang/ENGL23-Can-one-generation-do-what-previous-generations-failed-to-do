“If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered.” I took this quote from Ken's other lecture this week but wanted to comment here because it is directly relevant to our generation. At the end of the day, the difference in whether our society generally makes the lifestyle changes necessary to curb climate change comes down to motivation. As Ken discussed in the lecture, plenty of people in the generations preceding us knew at some level that major changes were necessary. Despite that knowledge, people at varying levels of power in other forms (industry, politics, etc.) failed to act upon that knowledge in an appropriate manner. To make matters worse, even now many of those people are unwilling to relinquish the “freedoms” that come with making unsustainable lifestyle choices. Now, our generation and all others left on the planet today are faced with the power to make a difference in combating the climate crisis but only if we act upon what we know. 

<br><br>
While I do believe that there is a ceiling to the impact our generation can have in our response to climate change, I also believe that that ceiling is higher than any other generation. If we can commit to making even some of these changes and convince our parents to do the same, we will make a difference. With that being the case, the question remains: How do we motivate ourselves and each-other to make significant lifestyle changes? While the answer surely varies from person to person, I think that there is one that has been almost completely underutilized. We could be the generation that saved the planet. It sounds corny, immature even, but for a generation that has consumed billions of dollars (and counting) worth of “hero-based content” (think of Marvel Movies, Star Wars, or take your pick of video games), we have an actual opportunity to save the world. While that may not be enough for everyone, I think that promoting that image in campaigns for lifestyle changes would have a profound effect on a lot of people.

I completely agree; I also believe that although many people are reluctant to live in an environmentally friendly way, we still have the chance to fight this crisis and mitigate its detrimental effects. Ken explains that the main reason why people are unwilling to accept this lifestyle is because they believe it is undermining the "American" life. Many of them argue that because they worked hard and earned money to buy luxurious houses and efficient cars, they shouldn't be disallowed from continuing to live their lives the way they desire to. In addition, an environmentally friendly lifestyle does not seem appealing at first, since they would be restricted in multiple ways, such as having to reside in smaller homes. Despite these difficulties, however, I truly believe it is vital to change the way we live everyday. 
<br><br>
Ken mentions how there are five ways we can help to fight the crisis: lowering our use of transportation, moving into a smaller home, wasting less food, having no more than one child a person, and rethinking our consumeristic culture. Transportation and housing alone takes a quarter each of our climate footprint, and wasting food has been the second largest producer of greenhouse gases. Additionally, our consumeristic culture has risen to such a level that everything we purchase has carbon footprint on it, and we can greatly reduce the amount of carbon footprint if we only bought items that we actually need. 
<br><br>
Ultimately, I also find it alarming that we spend a large amount of money in our everyday lives over media, entertainment, and other items that feed into consumerism. As Ken mentions, although these suggestions may seem difficult at first, they can go a long way in fighting the problem that is destroying our planet.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your entire comment on our generation's possible impact on saving and acting on climate change. Just as you started your quote out with the fact that when not acted upon, the power that knowledge possesses is "squandered", I believe that this applies most to our generation. That is not to say that previous generations before us did not have knowledge of climate change. It was just not as much of a common and repeated knowledge as it is now. It might have been looming knowledge behind people's minds, but our generation faces it as one of the "biggest crisis" of this century. 
<br><br>
This is also why I believe and agree to your metaphor that our generation has the highest ceiling of impact on climate change. With the amount of information presented directly at us, emphasizing that the climate change would impact us the most, that it would impact our posterity, we are the ones that should care the most and act the most. However, this does not mean that everyone in our generation is acting on improving the crisis. Many of us still continue and refuse to give up the comfortable lifestyle that the developed world grants us, at the cost of the environment. However, if, just like you said, we can consume billions of dollars on hero-based and doomsday content, then why can't we shift our consumption and lifestyle in actually acting? I believe that shifting our consumer culture to climate-efficient ways could benefit our generation's impact.
<br><hr>
I agree with you with Ken's quote at the very end of the video on his last lecture video, "knowledge is only power when acted upon, otherwise knowledge is power squandered", is quite the tell-tell all for our generation and the fate of the many here afterwards, whether our generation takes the knowledge of climate change that has been collected by the generations before us and use it for the better good of humanity and all life on the planet or leave the knowledge and watch the world turn for the worse. An issue that I see that can be preventing our own generation from using this knowledge as power against climate change is the fact that our culture has ever grown more into this material based culture where, as Ken states, "Bigger the Better" through the continued idea of the "American Dream", where upward mobility through hard work is an all possibility. Now don't get me wrong, a person who has worked their tail off to get where they are shouldn't be bashed, but there should be a sense of awareness that the world doesn't go around them. I believe this to be a major issue in our generation and many before us where people become self center and only care for themselves, oblivious to what consequences equate from their own actions. In the film, "The True Cost", it opened my eyes to the greater consequence that the fashion industry has had on the world where many lives are put at risk in developing countries like Bangladesh just to fill our fashion niches. Becoming minimalist, as in the films "being the Change" and "Minimalism" , reveals to us how much we can cut down on our carbon footprints through living within a minimalist lifestyle, like Ken's friend Peter Kalmus. But to the point, I believe if we spread the knowledge we gain from the teachings of Ken and other sources such as the films, we can enlighten our generation to turn this knowledge into power rather than let it squander until the problem is right in our face. 
<br><br>


As for your solution, I like the idea putting money into campaigns to promote lifestyle changes, climate change knowledge and solutions, as our generation itself is a generation of tech. We derive much of our knowledge from our phones and laptops and being able to campaign on through marches and online advertisement can be a motivating and even greatly moving in gather followers in pushing for action on climate change. Understanding that, as you stated, our generation has blown billions just on superhero movies like the marvel films, star wars and others, why not turn that money around and write our own hero story and rename our generation as the heroes and saviors of Earth?
<br><br>


But in all honesty, I believe reaching out over the internet and preaching Ken's 5 lifestyle changes that will better impact the world will immensely have a profound effect on those curious, worried or even don't understand the climate change situation that we are under right now. Knowing the technological capability of our generation, we can do many things to bring about the awareness of climate change to the average goers of the internet and hopefully the greater United States and begin a new culture that detaches itself from the American Dream.

<br><hr>
I agree with you, as I too am weary that my generation will have the tools to make a difference and yet we still won’t. We cannot repeat history and acknowledge climate change, while not making a difference. Our knowledge is only powerful if we act on it. I agree with Ken that this is a generational issue, which gives me hope that we will become inspired to act. We must vote politicians into office who believe in climate change and are committed to new policies. My parents often say the same excuses Ken stated about climate change, which means our generation must push back. As my generation begins to lead the way, we cannot fall into the trap of luxury and constant innovation. We must remember that the freedom to have luxuries comes at a cost.
 <br><br>

As Ken discussed 5 different ways we individually can lessen climate change, it seems plausible that we can make a difference. Choosing to live in cities with a smaller house and no car is not difficult. Cutting meat out of your diet certain days of the week is not difficult. Small choices everyday can reduce our collective carbon footprint, allowing us to be the generation that does make a change. As a generation that cares about the future of our planet, we must make an effort to consume and waste less. We must be inspired to act and stand up for what is right. While this is much harder to implement than it is to discuss, we each can start by changing how we live our everyday lives. Starting with small changes can make a large difference.
<br><hr>
Thank you for sharing and I totally agree with your comment! I also think there is a heavier and larger share of responsibility resting on the shoulders of us and our generation due to the inaction and the indifference from the older parental generation towards climate change. However, as much as Ken said in this week's lecture video that we as the new rising generation are counted on for mitigating the climate crisis and saving our planet, all of this would only be empty talk on paper and online if no actual effective actions are taken to directly address the problem of climate change. In simpler words, we would still fail our planet and the hopes from the older parental generation if we only talk the talk but do not walk the walk. In order to prevent this from happening and to actually encourage our generation to take immediate actions to remediate the climate crisis, I think the very first step would be raising the public awareness and consciousness of the issue of climate change through social media and other platforms that are especially popular among people of my generation today so that more and more people of my generation would come to the realization and recognize the anthropogenic harm and destruction on our planet, thus prompting them to pay more close attention to this issue and ponder ways they can get involved to solve this issue. After this initial step of spreading the word and raising public awareness, the second step would be promoting and educating the public particularly people of my generation of the ways they can participate in the efforts to preserve our environment through means such as guest speaker lectures, online campaigns, online advertisements, youth demonstrations, and many more.

Motivation is something we will definitely need if we want to save our planet and give generations to come the opportunity to live long lives without having to worry about the climate crisis daily. I agree with you that without motivation, we won't be able to succeed. Unfortunately, I think that a key issue in this is that after most of us finish this class, we won't remember the magnitude of the climate crisis and won't go forward with taking the necessary steps to save the earth. Although I want to be optimistic regarding this issue, I know that we need education about climate change (including fossil fuels and the beef industry) consistently throughout our lives. Whether it's campaigns as commercials on the TV or rallies worldwide year after year, we need to realize that the consequences are here to really want to make these changes. I know that many people in the younger generations want to live healthier and more sustainable lifestyles, but all of humanity needs to make these steps now or it might be too late.
<br><br>


Looking at the different ways we could achieve lower carbon footprints that Ken highlighted, I realized that literally everyone can make a change to help our earth. Before watching this video lecture, I thought that the only significant changes can be made if we completely switch our lives around, but this is false. Not buying into the consumer culture we have right now is an easy and huge difference we can all make. Riding a bike or walking to work or school is one also. All of the little steps add up and can save our planet if we all take them. Talking to your parents after taking this course and explaining to them the negative impact fossil fuels and humans in general have on our earth might make them understand the magnitude of this situation and get more people to join this movement.

I would agree that motivating older generations to make lifestyle changes will be hard. If they were not motivated 30 + years ago, I do not foresee them acting now as they have even less time on this planet. I think the angle that needs to be worked to convince older generations to join into this inter-generational solidarity of sorts is to remind them of their kids, grand kids, and other generations to come. I think that this also goes back to the smoking example from a few videos back. If grandparents knew that their actions were as harmful to their kids and grand kids as smoking around them non-stop, I think there would be that mobilization to change.
<br><br>


I would also agree that our generation is limited in terms of we can do. Of course the CO2 already in the atmosphere will have an incredibly long residence time and even if we magically switched over to 100% renewables over night, we would still see warming for decades after. However, if our generation decides to live like those before us and make it someone else's problem, future generations will have to bear the ultimate burden. At least if we curb our excessive lifestyles now, the future will be milder for longer, maybe leaving time for innovation or technological advances that could indeed stop the climate crisis all together. It is going to take one hell of a paradigm shift in terms of what we value and how we live our lives but I think we can do it. Moving towards being sustainable may mean giving up luxurious lifestyles, but it does not mean giving up family, friends, and the experiences that make life worth living. I think as long as we have these core supporters that this generation can be the ones who curb climate change.
<br><hr>
As Ken talked about in the other lecture for this week, plenty of Americans knew the climate was changing decades ago. But instead of acting before matters became worse they turned a blind eye, only increasing emissions by the year. Although the previous week's lectures have focused on the fact that the Boomer generation basically are responsible for most of the climate crisis, I find it difficult to be angry at them. While any positive change on their behalf would have significantly made an impact, it is hard to blame them. Many people knew that the climate was changing but since they didn't see it, they didn't have the motivation to change. But now, we are all seeing the consequences, and it is our -- and future -- generations that will suffer the most. But how can we criticize the previous generations, yet there are so many of us in this class even, who haven't made any effort to change. Myself included has benefitted extremely from our fossil fuel economy. I grew up benefitting from efficient transportation, was spoiled with clothes and other excessive amounts of mostly unused objects, and still eat meat. I personally took this class with the motivation of learning more about the climate crisis, in hopes that the knowledge I learned would drive me to make sustainable lifestyle changes. I found your comment to be really inspiring; despite how corny the "heroes of our planet" message might sound -- I genuinely believe it is a great idea considering the fact that our Western independent culture does seem to be drawn to ideas of uniqueness or "standing out among the crowd". I think advertising simple methods such as these with the hero mentality would make a huge difference in teens and those still on the fence.
<br><hr>
I second everything you mentioned in your comment. We can complain about all the ways previous generations have screwed over our planet or we can shut up and fix it. Knowledge without action IS power wasted and idleness can no longer be an option for this generation. And like you said, the crazy part is we actually have the ability to fix this crisis.  We are currently at a point were hesitance is damaging, and ignorance is catastrophic.  I was just having a conversation with my friends about the upcoming election, which then led into climate change, and one of them said, "We don't have anymore excuses for inaction. We all can vote now, are old enough to know the gravity of what is happening, and have the resources to help make create change." I'm tired of people our age feeling like they can't change anything because they don't have money or aren't in a position of power. Votes count. Actions breed results. And every. human. effort. matters.
<br><hr>
I like your relation to Marvel movies and the idea of attracting attention to climate change through advertisements that many people would be interested in. This relates to how humans put their money towards things that are deemed "popular" at the time, and objects/things that are desirable to many others. After watching this lecture, I wasn’t very surprised by what Ken was stating, nor was it anything I haven’t heard before. Many humans want to live lavish lives and view that as being “successful.” The reality is, simple living arrangements such as a micro apartment not only is better for the earth/climate, but cheaper to do so as well. There are so many upsides to taking action against climate change through altering one’s lifestyle, yet it seems not too many know the benefits of these changes, or merely do not care to do so. 
<br><br>

Altering one’s diet seems to be one of the more challenging tasks to undertake, especially in America. Statistically, the United States is one of the most obese countries in the world, and this rate continues to rise as the years go on. As a very large component of the carbon emissions in the atmosphere, America seems to be giving the least amount of effort to resolve such problems. Like Ken stated, “the American lifestyle has grown more and more environmentally disastrous.”  I don’t understand how people would be able to get solutions such as eating less, buying less, and having less children into their minds. From the earliest times of American history, this country began with the idea of consumer culture, and practically having the ideal lifestyle of having the freedom to pursue whatever they desire. Over time, this desire began equating to success, which in my opinion, is one of the main reasons for the lack of change this country is seeing from politicians to the average citizen. Ken stated that being environmentally aware was not something that had been taught to people in his generation, so if this same thing is not being installed into the minds of students as they are young and learning, how could college students make such a change in their lives? Numerous college students of today grew up seeing their parents and others be ‘successful’ by having a high paying job, a large house, and a big family. The last two of the three are what Ken was saying humans need to change. Does this alter the meaning of success in not only America, but around the globe as well? I fully understand what the gist of the video was, and that several students believe such a change in lifestyle is manageable/desirable. What I cannot grasp is what will truly convince a human being to actually create that change in their life, and not continue growing up feeling that what they have isn’t enough?

<br><hr>
I strongly agreed with your opinion. Nowadays, people understand the importance of protecting our environment but they do not want to make any effort.
<br><hr>
Reading your last paragraph was very insightful. To build upon your idea of being able to save the world, similar to the content of much of our entertainment today, I can see many reasons for people choosing to be complacent and not take action. For one, our culture, the one responsible for the climate crisis, is extremely self-centered and they wouldn't be getting any of the credit that Iron Man gets for saving the world. It would be a group effort. I find it sad, but if you think about it, how many people would go vegan, stop driving a car, etc. if they were able to get credit for "saving the world." I think we are creating our own demise with having our focuses in completely the wrong places. If it is not feasible to make something green, we don't question whether or not it is truly necessary for our life at its core, we simply shrug off the massive carbon footprint we leave behind. Unfortunately it seems as the more developed society becomes, the less connected we become, and the more we place extraordinary value on non-essentials. An attempt at a group effort in which we save the world together by sacrificing luxuries for no immediate reward? with our current culture? Wow! This is where the core of the problem is I believe, we've adopted such a value system that allowed us to get to where we are on this planet by destroying it for ourselves and others. I think the argument FOR fossil fuels of "we wouldn't be where we are today economically without burning them", however true or untrue it may be is besides the point. Would it not have been better to be (perhaps) slightly less behind economically and technologically if we took care of our home at the same time?
<br><hr>
I agree that at the end of the day it comes down to targeting what's gonna motivate people. But in your comment, it comes off as that it is completely up to our generation. While I think you are right in that our ceiling is higher than other generations, I don't think that it should be completely up to us. The older generation needs to realize that they had some part in this and that they can make some type of change. Like Ken said in the video, the older generation tends to think that any of the five changes would be horrid and disruptive to their lives, we need to target them, we need to find what's going to motivate that generation, there are more boomers on earth and there are us. We're already in very deep and at this point, every single change we can make goes a long way. The American lifestyle is tremendously environmentally disastrous, we need to not only change our lives, our parents lives, but we need to also educate the next upcoming generation on the condition of the world and what we can do to change it. This is NOT a generational issue, this is not about blaming people, this going to affect every single person on this planet, so whether you contributed or not we need to either change or spread change.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with the statements you have made above. Very fortunately, I think that many of these lifestyle changes Ken mentioned are becoming popular and trendy among our generation. For example, buying clothes from thrift stores is a common activity people our age find fun and exciting and many new sustainable fashion brands are also popping up and becoming very popular. Another example includes buying products that are sustainable and reusable. Almost everybody I pass on the UCSB campus is carrying around a reusable water bottle, something I don't think was the norm even 10 years ago. One of the lifestyle changes I have personally made is becoming pescatarian. I made this decision early in my freshman year of college when I was first becoming exposed to issues related to climate change and how this simple change could have a profound impact on my carbon footprint. As I made this lifestyle change, I noticed how many other people had made this change and how common it was becoming. My personal decision has also impacted the way my family eats, my dad recently switching to a mostly plant-based diet and my mom and sister often eating pescatarian or vegetarian meals along with me. I think that these personal decisions can have much wider impacts than we intend and that these small changes can add up. 
<br><br>

I also think the comment you made about how our generation can be the one to save the world is not corny. I think that this is true and we should embrace it. I believe people like Greta Thunberg and others like her will go down in history as heroes, the people that saved the planet for future generations. I think that people are biologically compelled to follow others, which can be beneficial in this case. If more of these solutions become popular, the new norm and are seen as trendy lifestyles then our generation will be more inclined to live a more sustainable life.
<br><hr>
I second your comment, I really find it ironic that most of us consumers like you have mentioned, spend an enormous amount of time and billions of dollars with films that are "hero-based content". This phrase itself describes humanity and the amount of time we put in leisure. Given that, we still blindly tackle the real issue of our generation, climate change. How long will it take for us to stop funding these films, media, sports,  leisure events and etc, and actually start looking towards the real issue of our environment? Although it may seem corny and even I feel guilty about enjoying entertainment, Our world needs to realize that we are in need of real life "heroes" and that, these "heroes" resides within us. Humanity needs to see clearly that it is up to us to do something about climate change, not the media. We could all start by doing the practices that Ken has provided in the lecture video, and slowly adjust. It would definitely be difficult to assimilate and attempt at first, but at least we are trying our best to combat an issue that could question our existence in the future.
<br><hr>
Ken's take on knowledge, and how its power relies on action also resonated with me. Reading your comment, I couldn't help but truly ponder your question: "How do we motivate ourselves and each other to make significant lifestyle changes?" The older generation had all the facts and still did not do much to change their lifestyles. We have all the facts as well, but as you also said, the "ceiling is higher than any other generation," so what guarantees we won't follow in their footsteps. That thought began to suffocate me, but when you brought up the billion-dollar industry we've invested in films, I began to have hope. Yet, their ability to do so is because our country caters to consumerism. Hero-based content is highly-favored by Americans, so I then began to ask myself, do we want a clean planet more? The answer is yes. I think everyone wants to end the climate crisis, and I also believe that people who think its a hoax recognize that something is wrong, even if they do not think we're the cause. Climate change is real and its consequences are revealing itself on a global scale. America contributes to the 2/3 of the world's greenhouse gases, so it is obvious that we need to make the most changes. America revolves around the media and networking so I wholeheartedly agree that if we promote our ability to help the planet through campaigns, we may have a chance.
<br><hr>
I really like the approach you take to inspiring individual lifestyle choices. I'm always super adamant on saying that we should hold the corporations that put us in here in the first place for everything they've done and continue to do to worsen the climate crisis. That being said, I do acknowledge that we all do need some degree of lifestyle changes in order to curb emissions. I've heard many people say that they simply would not be willing to change their lifestyles to combat the climate crisis. I'll admit that I could personally do better and eat less meat but a burger can be so tempting in the moment which yes I know sounds dumb but it's something I've experienced. Anyways, it's disheartening that many many people would simply not be willing to make even tiny changes to help, which raises the question how do we inspire people to make those individual changes? Regardless of how small or big they may be. Use the angle of fear? We're already bombarded by the image of natural disasters, the ever looming thought of 2030 being a turning point for the planet and yet people don't seem to be willing to take action. I think the big issue now is how we communicate about the climate crisis. I like your approach of a "hero-based" angle. I think it's definitely something that we should start doing more because our generation really does have the power to be the heroes and be the ones who helped save the planet.

<br><hr>
I strongly agree with you. I took English 22 last year and continued to take English 23 this year again. I learned a lot from these two courses and my lifestyle changed a lot in some ways. I can understand why previous generations failed to protect the environment. They believe that humans can’t impact the environment and climate change is not a crisis because of the culture and the environment. There were not very many wealthy people so they tried to do what they can do to get a better life. For them, benefit and profit are always the first priority for them. Also due to technology limitations and the way to propagate information, not everyone got the chance to know about the climate crisis. Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do? I think yes we can. I stay optimistic about fighting climate crisis. In the lecture, Professor Ken Hiltner shared many ways to change our lifestyle in order to reduce our carbon footprint.  As an individual, our tiny change is just insignificant. However, if everyone in the world starts to this, I believe climate change will be solved in the near future.

<br><hr>
I also believe that even individual action sounds minimal or less of an impact, together they can make a big difference, and that the key is on whether or not we act. Just like Emma Watson once spoke in a United Nations Conference:" If not now, when? If not me, who?" If everyone can have such awareness and responsibility, together we can surely change the world. I also agree that we can actually be "the generation that saved the planet" as mentioned by Jason, because we, the younger generation, tend to more easily welcome new ideas and suggestions and has not made a lot of fortunes and settled in the society yet, so we can change our lifestyle without a big sunk cost that the older generation might incur. I think this is also one of the reasons why the older generation is less likely to change their lifestyle but rationalize their behaviors. This reflection of mine also propels me to reflect upon my daily decisions that might have an impact on our environment and promotes me to more carefully consider some personally important decisions such as housing and number of children to raise, as environmental impact is another factor to consider when making those decisions.
<br><br>

Ken also uses data abundantly, which makes his arguments more convincing and allows me to have a clearer and more practical idea about an action. That's the rather objective part of this video lecture, but I am also intrigued by the relative subjective part of the lecture, which derives from Ken's personal conversations with his students and people of his generation on the 5 ways to reduce our climate footprint. People's attitudes are distinctly different, but I also found knowing the younger generation welcoming those 5 ways a hopeful thing, since we as a generation are going lead the future to a large extent, although this also mean responsibility and some stresses on our shoulders. Finally, I am really happy to clearly know the ways to effectively reduce our climate footprint and will try my best to integrate these changes into my life.

<br><hr>
I agree with your perspective on the present generation being able to create changes for the better if we act now. The five things that Ken mentions is very logical as  transportation, housing, food waste, global population, and products all contribute to the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fossil fuel levels in our society. I think that America and other countries worldwide currently live in such a materialistic society where we are conditioned to think that bigger is better especially as obtainable resources are “the result of fruition” and sometimes becomes the reason we live life. In order to help the earth prevent further environmental issues, I think that people need to get rid of the stigmas behind being materialistically rich and instead focus on empathetic riches with mentality. To summarize, our society has always been a materialistic culture as seen with artifacts and currency. It just depends on us to reduce the amount we waste things as Ken states in his lecture not that we need to get rid of everything.
<br><hr>
I agree that our generation has the potential to make a lot of change and were expected to do so. Although some of these lifestyle changes do sound appealing, I know from experience that it can be difficult to change old habits. The fact that using a car accounts for a quarter of your climate footprints is mind blowing. Before I got to UCSB, I had never relied on the use of public transit. However, now that I use it everyday, I’m starting to understand that it is a better option, not only for the environment, but also for me. Not eating meat and attempting to maintain a plant based diet is also a really difficult change to make. Having less and purchasing less is extremely difficult, especially since here in America we seem to be addicted to spending money on unnecessary things. Although these steps can be hard to take, they are necessary. It’s sad we have to start doing this now, with such urgency, because these lifestyle changes weren’t practiced in the past when the climate crisis was worsening. At 16, I was already contemplating whether or not I would even have children because of overpopulation and because I had no idea what the future would look like for them. With the motivation to make a change and do your part, any of these lifestyle changes can be made within any individual. Nothing goes unnoticed.
<br><hr>
I really like your analogy of the ceiling above our generation. I think it is very insightful and very real to not take lightly how much humans have already taken a destructive impact on our environment. But I do think it is crucial for us to know and have the optimism that we can make a change. Having new campaigns, new advertisements, and new marketing that is focused toward living life cleanly could be crucial in actually promoting clean habits for each individual in effort to make a change as a collective group. Getting more celebrities and well-known individuals to make personal statements on changing their ways will also help to promote others to act the same. Humans are so influenced by one another that it is truly time to start influencing in the right ways. It is already becoming “cool” and “trendy” to wear second-hand clothes and drive an electric car. We are in the right direction, there is just a lot more room for improvement. Hearing this video made me realize why I decided to take this class. I didn’t just come to hear the scary facts, to leave class each time with a sense of dread on the reality of our future if we don’t make a change. I came to learn what I can do, as an individual of the generation that is our world’s last hope, and I really feel like Ken is giving the tools that I needed to hear. I hope my other classmates feel the same, as 900 college students make up an important part of our world’s future.

I completely agree with you, Jason. Whether we want to make those lifestyle changes  to reduce our carbon footprint is entirely up to us. We have the power to do so, but it really depends on whether we want to make those necessary changes. People are just afraid to make these changes, they are reluctant to transition into a more eco-friendly lifestyle. We as a society have gotten too comfortable with our carbon heavy lives. Who doesn't love the luxury of driving our cars, eating meat, riding airplanes, or living in unnecessarily big houses? At the end of the day, we really don't need any of those things. It really is corny, how our society will put away so much money for entertainment. Millions of dollars are used to produce these extremely well- made movies, but really what is the point? That money could be used to promote lifestyle changes and  organizations and companies trying to mediate the effects of climate change. Since we obviously cannot depend on these money hungry companies, it is up to all of us to make the change necessary. It's not hard to cut back from eating meat, you don't even need to completely remove it from your life. There is so many alternatives than driving a car.If everyone is motivated to change their lives a little, we could be working for a healthier planet. None of these proposals are hard, none of these changes will make our lives any harder. We, as a society, just need to all come together and agree that it's up to all of us to take care of our planet.
<br><hr>
I agree with the idea that our expectations for our generation's impact on the planet is higher than others, however, most of the people in our generation are not in a position to have enact much change. It is a generational wide problem that needs to be fixed on all levels. The people with the most power are the generations above us. So it is necessary to convince others of the problems that we will most likely face later down the road. 
<br><br>

I appreciate the hero reference, I think it is an apt analogy to the way our minds like to play out scenarios -- it is a great motivator. But the reality lies with the helplessness of the sole individual, there is no way a single person can influence that much change. We kinda need to think of the issue in terms of being contagious. Treat environmentalism as a virus. We need to convince others of the issues at hand to grow the movement into a global virus. This is the most probable solution to the issue of enacting change in the future.
<br><br>

If we do not an initiative towards spreading our message, then our society will slowly succumb to the effects of the previous generation’s negligence. The growing population is only going to expedite the issue. We need to take up the five steps that Ken laid out in the video and spread the message. If we do not take up a role ourselves, then how will anyone else listen to our complaints?
<br><hr>
Like what you said in the comment, it is true that our generation would have a better chance of saving the planet. However, it is still a big challenge for many of us. We have the intention to do what we can within our own ability, but it is not enough for our generation to change or at least help with the climate crisis. I believe any of the people have been to New York City, and people enjoy the life they have with convenient public transportation, a closer grocery store from where they live, sometimes they can even just walk to their favorite cafe. All of the conveniences NYC provides cost thousands of dollars of the rent for the more expensive and smaller spaces that would lower the carbon footprint for a person. And not all or the majority of the American people could afford such a high-cost lifestyle immediately; it takes a while, or even a few decades to be achieved. Even though we do have to face challenges this crisis brings us, and we are still in the progress of educating those who do not care and will not do anything to help the environment, at least we are changing, and there will definitely be even more people changing and solving the difficulty.

<br><hr>
Just because the previous generation got away with their excessive and destructive lifestyles, it doesn't mean we're allowed to. The previous generation is not a precedent or a standard of how future generations could live; rather, it's a fundamentally flawed generation that failed at leaving the earth as habitable as when they entered. I think you point about the need for our generation to make a difference is important. We, as a generation, needs to realize that we can't follow the same path that our parents have followed. Instead, we should expect major changes and understand that those changes are for a greater cause. 
<br><br>
Unlike the previous generations, our lives are profoundly impacted and informed by the internet. With such a revolutionary platform, I hope that proper awareness and correct information can be spread. Corny climate change deniers will be more exposed and open to critique, while scientists can share solutions on a international scale. I think the internet could potentially catalyze consensus in our generation's  stance on climate change. If it is the case, we can hope for radical changes to be implemented.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with your statement that we have a ceiling on what we can do as a generation. I think it is important that other generations stop looking toward us to completely solve this issue for them, we simply don’t have the ability to mend this much damage. At the same time, I do agree that our ceiling is higher, and we are collectively pushing the boundaries of what is capable - becuase we have to. At this point, the only thing that we have is the ability to try and reverse these effects and we have to innovate and craft ways that we can mitigate climate change. But I do feel that it is very unfair - the pressure and extremities of what we are expected to be able to face.
<br><br>

I feel betrayed by the generation above us as they condecendingly look down on us. They often blame us for consumerism and for making the planet a hostile place, when in reality, they are the ones that created all these issues for us. We are simply the generation where the effects of a lifetimes worth of environmental mistakes has surmounted and proven themselves in physical form as global climate change. I think it is time that collectively we agree that climate change is happening and work together to create what is necessary to mitigate it. I think the only way to get out of the crisis that we are in is to innovate. I believe that you can’t really change how stubborn people will act - and there are many stubborn people out there. But if you can innovate cool ways to help people be more sustainable, they will be forced into a sustainable lifestyle. We have to outsmart the generation that destroyed us.

<br><hr>
That quote you mentioned from Ken’s other lecture also resonated with me. Knowledge is an extremely powerful tool, but it can easily be squandered. The older generation did not take action with the knowledge they had, so it is up to us to use what we know for good. I love how you emphasized our opportunity to save the world and compared it to our Marvel obsession. We can all be a version of a superhero if we make personal decisions, even if they start simple, in our daily lives. 
 <br><br>
Ken’s lecture gave me a new perspective. I did not realize how settled America is into this environmentally disastrous lifestyle! The goal seems to be a big house, big family, nice car and without a sacrifice of meat. But the response Ken has gotten from our generation is one I share. My friends and I would love to move to a city, would not mind trading a car for a subway or bike, and the idea of being more environmentally conscious overall honestly excites us. I want to help, and I want to make a difference in any way I can. If the hardest thing I have to do is cut my meat intake in half, I will be excited to do it and try to get others on board as well. Our generation needs to be ready to embrace change, and I think a lot of us are.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. The history is gone, and we can not fix it. The only thing we can do is to learn from history and do better now. The couple generation after the industrial revolution and World War go through the big changing of life quality. This new world humans never face. They were not intentionally mess up the environment. The environmental problem is caused by the general trend and unconscious. In our generation, we need to think deeper, and aware of the problem earlier. This is exactly why we need class like engl 23.

<br><hr>
I found the idea of appealing to the hero image very striking. I myself felt like I was doing something truly selfless and heroic when I decided to make changes in my life in response to the documentary "Before the Flood." I think such an approach would work really well among younger populations. Another approach that I thought would work well is a religious one. I believe that we can view the climate crisis as God(s) test for humanity. Are we going to sit idly by as people poison our air and damage our world. Are we going to prioritize our comfort over the well being of other people and future generation. Are our leaders going to continue to mislead us and are fossil fuel companies going to destroy the world because they won't stop being greedy. I think this is a really good way of thinking about the climate crisis if you are religious, especially because religious people have often denied the climate crisis saying that it is foolish to think that we humans can truly cause changes in the climate. I say, God(s) are letting us do so as a test of the extent of our greed.
<br><hr>
Totally agree with your comment. We have this huge wait on our shoulders to undo the wronging of our elders. It will take a lot of work for our generation to fix that but I believe that our generation can. BUT we can't do it alone. We need lending hands from other generations. Don't just plead for our help, but actually help us do something about it. We have the power of media nowadays to spread information in a split second. Spread campaigns, spread awareness, spread solutions. Tell your parents, tell your friends, tell every one of your followers on twitter, instagram, facebook etc. WE HAVE THE POWER. I believe with the support of all of us, and we continue to push our peers everyday, we can accomplish anything we put our minds too. I choose to be optimistic, I choose to believe our generation can do this. I choose to believe WE CAN "SAVE THE WORLD".
<br><hr>
I strongly agree with your ideas regarding what actions that our generation can do about climate change. Also, I also do believe that motivation is an essential factor to impel us to act. People need to think about what they can get after they accomplish such a big goal. Someone might regard as a hero after they complete an almost impossible task. Our generation needs to have an awareness of the issue of global warming. A lot of us might think that if we still do not act to save the planet, what our earth will like in the next several decades? Can we still be alive in the next few decades? Once we have these ideas, we ought to at least try to take some actions to save our planet. Although one can not bring an enormous impact, a thousand, ten thousand, even a million will have a lot more influence. Therefore, we also need to communicate with others, such as our parents, teachers, and friends, to convince them to take action together. This is also a crucial step to have a bigger possibility to have more impact on our planet through our actions.

The video is really thought provoking and a catalyst for conversation. 
<br><br>
We all have made a big impact to the carbon emission catastrophe; we have all made such a big carbon footprint in such a short amount of time. However, let me correct myself not all of us, the poorest of the world have made such a small contribution to this disaster but have to suffer the worst of the consequences.
<br><br>

 However, we can do better. We can make changes. We can take public transportation instead of driving all the time. We can live smaller and minimize our consumption. We can choose to live simpler lives and thus help save the mother we all love, la madre tierra.

Ken lists five important ways to reduce our footprint in order to help the climate crisis. They are all really simple including transportation, housing, food and child control. However, at the same time those aspects are also hard to change. It required every one of the generation to participate in order to make the difference. The education of the next generation then is really significant, since it’s really hard to change the idea of this generation.

Yea you can vote and join activist groups but what can you actually do to help with the issue of climate change is the main point of Ken's lecture "Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?" This lecture talks about how to reduce your carbon footprint with the first being transportation. Instead of having a car maybe just try to take the train, subway, etc. I believe the most efficient would be if everyone just owned a bike instead of a car. Second is housing, where you can move to a city and live in smaller homes and even live with other people.The third is food waste which makes me upset because growing up i was taught to always finish everything on my plate since it will go to waste and there are literally people starving everyday. The fourth way is by having only one child. I feel bad about this one because I have three other siblings and couldn't imagine living without them. I would want my child to have a sibling who they can look up to/help but I would most definitely be willing to only have one child to help reduce my carbon footprint. The fifth and last way Ken mentions is basically having stuff such as clothing and whatnot. I also feel bad about this one because I have many articles of clothing and ones that i neglect and do not even wear. I would be willing to do these five things to cut my carbon footprint in half.

<p>
I feel that many people might think it will be hard or impossible to fix or stop the damage being done to the earth. I think that it will be hard due a lot of people being accustomed to living the way that they do. But it’s not impossible. I think that people are slowly starting to realize that some of their lifestyle choices aren’t for the best of the planet and slowly contribute to helping the planet. I think people are hesitant about changing where they live because I know people associate the size of their homes with how successful one is. However this generation is becoming more aware of the big threat that climate crisis is to their future and I genuinely believe that things can change for the better.

As someone who views the ideal lifestyle as one portrayed in the film, it feels almost un-American to idealize a life with less. Since the U.S. became prosperous it has been portrayed as a land with luxury and limitless potential. However, many in  my generation see the effects of overindulgent lifestyles on our planet, and wish to do better. America’s commercialism has created a culture surrounded by things, yet with no knowledge of the material cost of said item. 
 <br><br>
Understandably, generations that precede mine feel that their work is invalidated when switching to a smaller lifestyle. However, many luxuries that they enjoy now can be continued if they make small choices to help. Thrifting clothes, visiting local farmers markets, plant-based diets, and driving less are some very easy ways to start. The planet can only support so many people, so why shouldn’t we try to minimize our total footprints?

I think a younger generation is very capable of doing what the older generations couldn't do. At least I have to think that or my world view would be very depressing. That would mean we would never best the climate crisis. I think a big nudge in the right directions is that things that Fire in Paradise described as global weirding are happening right under our very noses. We can not avoid thinking about it and assigning a cause to it, hence we ned to acknowledge global warming.As for the things we can do ourselves to reduce our carbon footprint I think some of the actions need to be pushed more than others. You can not regulate childbirth as it is a violation of freedom in my opinion. What you can do is downsize new houses that are being build, tax having a car more and promote public transport. In doing so you will force our generation to adapt. I think a bit of force is necessary to apply as people will find it difficult to see the long term picture. At least I think are generation will be more capable of seeing it because we have directly experienced the repercussions of climate change.

Ken has a powerful message in the video: "for decades, the generation that controls our planet has adapted to a way of life -- it's an environmental nightmare." He added: "more importantly, my generation loves it." "I realized that we can really be the generation that makes that change. This also made me realize that this is not possible through simple adjustment. We are used to destroying the environment. What we consider a "normal" way of life is actually putting all of us, and the rest of the world, at risk. Although, as Ken says, past generations have been comfortable and even proud of what they have achieved, we can change the ways that were implemented in the past that were harmful to the environment.
 <br><br>
This video is particularly informative because it's not just about facts that support climate change. We are faced with practical solutions and ways our generation can change the world. It seems that one person's actions won't make any difference, but the small Numbers add up and we have to start somewhere. With so many people in the world, a constant, but small change in the masses can be very effective. If we make major changes in our lives to reduce our carbon footprint, we can make up for the loss of these generations.




</p><hr>


<p>

Ken's summary of the solutions for climate change was rally interesting as it highlighted the differences from generation to generation. Our carbon footprint SHOULD be easy to reduce if we adjusted our lifestyles and thats we SHOULD be doing. Hopefully the new generations live differently than us and hopefully avert from consumer culture.

As you have stated in your video, just having information about an issue is not enough because you have to be proactive and actually do something about it. You mentioned your generation knew that eating meat and burning coal and using oil would lead to the disruption of the planet, but I am just wondering why did not anyone act? Was it because they were not seeing the effects for themselves, so they decided it was not as important? It disheartens me because there was a nationwide consciousness of the issue, yet nothing was done back then and even today most people know about the issue but are unwilling to do what it takes to save the planet.
 <br><br>


In regards to the five things we can do, I am already doing two out of the five commitments; taking the bus and switching to a heavily plant-based diet. I have been vegetarian for a little more than a year now, but I have recently gone vegan because I know how much of a good impact it can be on the planet. I do not own a car, so I always take the bus wherever I need to go and I usually do not order a Lyft or Uber or carpool with friends. I’ve always wanted to live in a city when I was young since I was born in a city (Chicago, IL) so I know after college I will move into one. For some time during my life, I would complain about how my family and I did not live in a big house, but after some time realizing the negative impact it has on the planet and how it is not that bad living in a smaller place, I am extremely grateful and I love living in a smaller place. I did not realize how much food was being wasted every year and I feel guilty because sometimes I throw away food when I grab more than I can eat. (I can work on that though.) I stirred away from shopping at stores like Nike and Forever 21 before this class because I learned about the unfair labor practices in foreign countries where the items are produced. I shifted to buying less and if I ever bought clothes, I would usually go to a thrift store to make my purchases.

 <br><br>

I think a lot about the future and when I think about this issue, I see hope because I know my generation cares about this issue and there are solutions to these problems. I also have some optimism for the older generation because my mom, for example, had taken up going vegetarian for a couple of days because she knows of the climate footprint it has on the planet. I feel like we can get more people on board, we just have to reach them and get them to understand how important it is for the entirety of the planet.

Professor provides five ways for us to change the situation of climate. Less transportation and less houses seem to achieve easily. But nowadays, people prefer to live in a big house, especially in the US which have less population and bigger land. Also, we can know the meat especially the beef produces too much carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. They also consume large amount of water. If we can be vegetarian, the carbon dioxide emission will be reduced a lot. Also, we cannot waste food. At the end, a couple can just grow up one children, because population also contribute to the global warming. A large population means more consumption of food and clothes which will produce much more carbon dioxide. These things are some ting things that we can do daily. But these ways only can be done by us. The old generation has a different viewpoint. They weigh their cars, houses and clothes much more than the global warming. They do not care global warming as much as we do.



</p><hr>


<p>

I found it astonishing, although it honestly makes sense, that cars and our houses contribute to half of our individual carbon footprint. I think it would be more feasible, although not by much, for people to give up their cars for mass transit because moving out of a home that one has paid for and created a life in for so long would be much more difficult. Additionally, people have different preferences, so not everyone would like to live in cities despite the decrease of carbon emissions from having a smaller living space and reduced use of cars. I agree that our appetite to stuff has contributed largely to this problem, because it shows in our purchases of cars, clothes, technology, and food. There is absolutely no need to get a new phone every year despite companies introducing a new model annually, they just convince people that they aren't desirable, or that they will be better because they have the newest thing. 

 <br><br>

Our American way of life is all about what we have and are able to have due to our right to freedom. Especially since the boomer generation has lived all their lives like this and feel entitled to all these freedoms, it's difficult to change their mindsets. What the newer generations can do is establish a minimalist way of life as normal and to ensure that future generations see the value in it. This doesn't mean we should give up trying to convince the older generations the seriousness of the climate crisis, it's just another important way to channel our energy to ensure solidarity among the human race to combat the climate crisis.

Kens lecture confirms my belief that desire for more is a strong component of why the climate crisis is getting worse. In the sense of American life, people have the desire to get something better and bigger with no consideration for its environmental impact.. This is largely due to the fact that they don't see how these choices in life impacts the environment. Ken offers his solution to the climate crisis in 5 ways which in terms of modern western life is very radical. People are resistant to change and that is the only way to combat the crisis. People's desire for something more and bigger leads to an overproduction of consumption. We consume more and more and what we don't need is sent straight to the incinerator. The issue with climate change is the fact that it is impossible for us to see our own contribution to it. However, this doesn't mean it isn't real as many other people on the world suffer from the effects while we as Americans prosper.

<p>

After watching this video, I can't say that I'm not surprised by the 5 ways that Ken mentioned could help. House, food, transportation, child, is that it? Is it that simple? Indeed, it is. In Environmental Studies, I learned that transportation and housing are responsible for at least 50% of an average American's ecological footprint. It's hard to argue this because we all know what's "idealized lifestyle" here in US. Big mansions, huge pick-up trucks, lots of food, those are all what people are pursuing. It's not hard to tell that they need one thing in common----resource. When we are consuming all those stuffs, we are taking all those resources from our environment, which is not sustainable.
 <br><br>
However, even if we are aware that those actions could work, what's next? It's never a easy step to reduce one's life quality when he/she has enough buying power to enjoy those stuff. Thus, we need to improve people's awareness of saving our environment and teach them important values. There's one quote that I found interesting for me: "The best things in life are't things". Truly, the things we value the most shouldn't be stuffs. Once people are accepting values like this, I believe that they can reduce the things they use in their life and lead a simple but meaningful life.

This video made me want to be more committed to my dietary habits. I have been on and off pursuing vegetarian and vegan diets. Having roommates who are also vegan and vegetarian makes it easier for me, but whenever I go home for holidays or go to work I find it difficult to stay committed only because I hate causing a hassle for other people. Watching this made me realize that the environmental benefits of committing fully to this far outweighs the hassle for other people. I don't want my carbon footprint to be ginormous when it doesn't have to be, and especially not because I'm worried about what other people think or about how much of a hassle it is for them to accommodate my dietary restrictions. Also I have been without a car for almost 2 years now, and when I need to travel further distances than just campus, I either take the train or do a rideshare. One thing I need to work on that Ken spoke upon was minimalism. I feel that I have way too much unnecessary items in my possession, and I think I would feel much better if I get rid of some of it. Like if I haven't used it in the last 3 months what's the chance I'm gonna need it in the future? Slim, exactly. Might as well cut down on the items I consume, especially if they're going to waste. Overall, I enjoyed listening to this lecture video as it inspired me to crack down on myself and not let myself slide when it comes to my carbon footprint.

<p>
This video made me really rethink the carbon footprint that I am leaving on this earth. Some of the things that Ken mentioned that are bad for the planet were things that was already aware of like transportation, living, eating a more plant based diet rather than meat, and wasting less food . However, I did not know think about limiting the amount of children someone can have and the material things that we use on an everyday basis. It is very clear how both of those things contribute to the climate crisis. Less children means a smaller population which would be beneficial for our planet as it is extremely overpopulated. Also, when it comes to material items, everyone can buy more eco-friendly items and can also cut back on a lot of things are not technically necessities but more as a want. After watching this video I will definitely be making more of an effort to save the planet by trying to walk or ride my bike more rather than driving, by living in a smaller home, and by eating less meat and just not wasting food in general.

This video addresses the issue of climate change in a more pragmatic way than most of Ken's other videos which talk on the facts and figures of climate change as an anthropogenic issue. The five main ways to combat climate change on the personal level, as talked about in this video, were moderately simple. To make a decent impact on climate change and reduce your carbon footprint, all you have to do is choose the most environmentally friendly option in your transportation, housing, diet, family size, and shopping. Ken's video also demonstrates the common responses towards the proposed ideas of what an environmentally conscious lifestyle looks like. I must say that this was a wonderful addition to the video because although I, and many of people in my generation, may agree with the first or second response, the "that's not so bad at all" response,  but it is important to be aware that other people maybe reacted more closely to the third or fourth response.

 <br><br>

I found it really interesting that the video suggested that one should live in an urban city. I have always figured that an urban area with a high population was directly linked to an increase in carbon emission but in reality it makes sense to move to a city like Portland or New York because of the easily accessible public transportation as opposed to living in a rural area where the nearest train is probably an hour away. 

 <br><br>

I am interested in learning more about what we can do to combat climate change. I feel like learning how to deal with the issue of global warming is far more important than learning of its current effects.

I have a lot of hope for this generation, but I also have some doubts. The fashion industry has exploded and they've been marketing to my generation to constantly buy new clothes. On top of that, social media feeds into the perception that one must have all the new items. This is only the beginning of fast fashion and I'm scared of what's to come. Despite this, I do have a lot of hope for my generation. Veganism, minimalism, and sustainability has been extremely common nowadays. These lifestyles are becoming normalized and encouraged by our peers, and many people are becoming inspired to follow the same lifestyle. Not only that, but my fellow peers are very active in environmental justice. I'm very happy to see the progress we've made despite the detrimental damage of the boomer generation. I'm excited to see how we will progress from here, and I know that we have a lot of work to do.

From the first lecture video "Can one generation do what previous generation failed to do", five things that Americans can do to dramatically reduce climate footprints are mentioned: walking or taking means of public transportation, selecting micro-apartment to live, wasting less food and eating plant-based diet food as more as possible, bearing only one child per family, and rethinking our relationship to stuff. However, the responses Ken received were negative and there are not many people want to live like this because Ken's generation were not taught to pay attention to their carbon footprint. And Ken hopes his students can be affected by some climate activism and be the changing part of new generation. And in the second lecture, he listed many examples of industry that harms climate to let we know that we should use less fossil fuels. I think Boomer generation would realize this fact thoroughly and make a change.

First, generations should have a public recognition about climate crisis, at least admit it existence. Transportations and housing occupied a large footprint of human activities that might need to reduce to ensure there is enough living space for wildlife. The waste of food is also another issue for Americans that will be criticized because of the look of food (ex. Wholefood will only select foods with a good look that sells better, which means a huge of waste of food that does not qualified). Although China’s One Child Policy could be unethical, but it effectively reduces the population. Less population, less activities and less carbon emission in the future. Moreover, California has a terrible public transportation that a household might have more than two cars to maintain a regular daily commute. The traffic is another problem for people to arrive their workplace. I will suggest the state government better develop the public transportation to ease the stress of traffic problem. Thus, people will live closer to the Downtown and leave more space to other species.

In this video, Ken gave us a few options that we could do and cut our carbon foot print. I am truly surprised that we could easily cut our carbon foot print by half by just doing a few changes. Ken’s information of food struck me the most. I am currently on a diet, trying to find the most scientific and healthy diet to lose weight. And now I learned that I could be contributing only one thirtieth of the green house gases by just switching my beef to lentils.
 <br><br>

 Also, wasting food in my dorm’s cafeteria has also been a big problem for me. As a international student, the food in my dorm’s cafe hasn’t been appealing most of the time, but I still want to try their new stuff, half of the time eating their, I end up wasting some of the food I took. I am not proud of this at all. Since I’m on my diet already, I guess I’m gonna stick with salad most of the time. 
 <br><br>

Buying less clothes is a great idea, I am the exact opposite of fast fashion. This is due to a number of reasons. I am very loyal to the brand Uniqlo, I have my turtle neck, blazer, shirt, pants, jeans, all from this brand, and since I moved here for school, I haven’t bought myself new clothes, this mainly because of the fact that the closest Uniqlo shop is in Oxnard, and I don’t trust online shopping clothes. Secondly, when I buy clothes, I go for my absolutely loved ones. I love my dark blue turtle neck a lot, and I wear it a lot, I get lots of compliments, and yet nobody knows that the turtle neck is just one of the three choices I have for winter/autumn. I change things up a little with my black polo shirt and that’s it. 
 <br><br>

I believe Ken’s suggestions are viable and crucial to the fate of our planet.

I think this film is great. Ken tells us a few suggestions about how to reduce the effects brought by greenhouse gases and what we can do to reduce the usage of greenhouse gases. Since greenhouse gases are the major causes of climate change, greenhouse gases lead to the increase of temperature and the increase of temperature leads to climate change.  First, Ken suggests us to eat less meat and eat more vegetables. As when the time we produce meat, we produce two to three-times of greenhouse gases then we produce vegetables. So eating less more meat and more vegetables can reduce the releasing greenhouse gases. Second, we should buy fewer things. As we waste two-third of the things we produced. And when we are producing these goods, we release a lot of greenhouse gases. Therefore, these three suggestions are really useful.

I agree with Ken's arguments in both videos. They are deep and thoughtful to me. Especially in "Can on generation do what previous generation failed to do", I find the differences in understanding or accepting one specific idea between generations. According to my own experience, sometimes I feel hard to communicate with my parents or my grandparents because they hold different opinions with me on some problems. Related to the climate crisis, their generation is hard to change their thoughts or understand regarding how to reduce the impact of climate change. They follows what they believe as "freedom". It is true that they spent their lifetime to achieve the "freedom", which is having a car, a big house, eat whatever they want to eat, and buy whatever they want to buy. Their principles are rooted in their thoughts deeply which are pretty hard to change. Oppositely, my generation feels much more easier to accept one concept. In Ken's five suggestions, I can do at least three of them, excepting for eating meat which is a habit I cannot change easily. Compared to older generations, our generation is willing to change and accept new concepts. I believe as my generation become more influential in the society, the country will become differently acting on ideas of climate crisis. The change made by our generation will gradually affect the older generations to follow our actions. I believe footprints made by human being will disappear.

<p>
Well, I totally agree with what Ken said, but unfortunately, I might not be able to complete all five of the steps. Psychologically, the Pyramid of Motivation tells that beyond eating and sleeping, we have the yearning toward beauty, toward artistic fulfillment, and toward love. The agitated puberty for every teenager is unavoidable. We need to have fun, we need to buy new clothes to find love, and we need to live in a big house to really relax. The attractions from the outside world are pretty challenging to say no to, but I hope I, at least I, will follow the suggestions in order to save us in the long run.

After watching Ken's short youtube lecture "Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?", my eyes are opened to the fact that there ARE everyday things even I could see myself partaking in to reduce my carbon footprint. Its funny because without realizing it, I shop at thrift stores regularly just because I find the clothes there to be two things- cheaper and trendier, and I guess now I can add a third- environmentally friendlier. On another note, although some may disagree with that living in a smaller house is less desirable, in my experience I feel like families are more closely-knit in these "cozier" homes rather than those who live in what you described as "McMansions." One thing that I think that all or most of us could be proud of is that we are such a bike centered community/college compared to other schools. For example, my friends who go to USC (ironically a primarily conservative school), take ubers everywhere- to class, to parties, etc... whereas here at UCSB and in Isla Vista, it is unlikely to go out on a weekend night and not see hundreds of people walking, biking, and skating around as means for transportation. To address a more unfortunate issue, I do not see an efficient way to reduce the amount of food waste in the United States just because it is just one of those things that is out of our reach to solve. I will, however, take a personal challenge and eat 100% of what I put on my plate because I know I will feel better about myself and who knows, someone might notice and change for the better too.

This film talks about 5 aspects of what people can do to save the environment and analyzes them. Also the film points out that those aspects are treated differently by the last generation and the reason behind their actions, which successfully concludes what gets the environment to this place nowadays and how we treat the environment in a right and comfortable way.
 <br><br>

 The film is suitable for common audiences like our generation, because it points out we can improve the environment from transportation, housing, food, population, and goods. Especially from transportation and housing, people can live in big cities and go out by public transportation, which protects the environment by having less people living in suburb area and only going out by cars. But at the same time, we need to think about that having more people living in urban area making purchasing in dense area go up so that the demand will be even bigger. So the balance should be well-controlled.
 <br><br>

The film also talks about different views between last generation and this generation. Because the last generation’s parents’ value of wealth is to have bigger house and have a “US life”, and surly the last generation inherits this value and refuses to change, since they desire “good life”. But for our generation, people are educated in a different way which teach people to have a higher value of protecting the earth mother.
 <br><br>

I would recommend this video to my friends, since it gots accurate evidences and sufficient reasonings for doing this, and our generation should really start to action on this to save the planet.

In my opinion, some of Ken's ideas are too optimistic, for example, to let more people focus on the big cities. First of all, the infrastructure and urban planning of big cities have become increasingly saturated. My hometown is Beijing. Every morning if you take the subway commuter, you will find that you have to wait at least three or four trains to get on the subway. If you don't have a car, your commuter will be a dream. Although the traffic congestion is also serious, at least you have a seat. If you choose to commute by public transport, you will face one to two hours of standing. At the same time, more people are corresponding to more pollution and more emissions, which will undoubtedly bring greater pressure to big cities. Secondly, the economy is also a big problem. I recently went to eat near USC. One of my friends told me that a single dormitory near USC costs at least 2000 US dollars.

After watching Ken’s Lecture videos and taking English 22 last quarter my environmental conscious has significantly evolved. One are of my life I have aimed to make the biggest change in is my consumption of “stuff”. Before learning about the fast fashion industry last quarter, I had no idea the impact the shopping I did had. While I previously seldom considered the products I was buying and the companies I was buying from, I now have a completely changed awareness of my consumption. Moreover I have begun to constantly ask myself “Do I need this, is it necessary?”. Just as Ken mentioned I am frustrated with our consumerist society and our obsession with “stuff”. I now shop with a newly developed consciousness, a change I believe is possible for everyone to make. 
    <br><br>
     As a kid I remember thinking I wanted to grow up to own a big house with lots of cars and all the luxurious associated with an extravagant lifestyle however my views since then have been radically changed. I now know that having a fulfilling lifestyle can be equally satisfied living through an environmental lens. While I already choose to not eat beef, I aim to transition to a vegetarian diet this year. I agree with Ken in the sense that sweeping change needs to be made, however I think the most effective way this could be accomplished would be through political change.

<p>
The interconnection and ethical holism our generation is necessary sooner rather than later. The present state of affairs will determine the outcome of the future. Consumerism, exercise > driving, ethical treatment of animals, and the production of less waste are enticing and achievable, but the hardest part is the first step and belief in change. All of this ethical holism shows admiration for the universe as a democratic whole - humans, animals, and planet. Under a pessimist doomer perspective, we can remain the way we are or change our direction. Being accustomed and indoctrinated into a life of individualist egotistic acquisition isn't sustainable. Postponing the inevitable outcome puts individual freedom before those of future generations.

While I found both lectures immensely informative “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?” struck me the most. Every point Ken made in this lecture is a helpful way to make the changes that are necessary in our climate crisis. The fact that the production of 30 pounds of lentils is the same as producing 1 pound of meat is mind blowing. If everyone just chose one day of the week to not eat meat it would have a significant positive effect. While there are many facts I found interesting the one that stood out the most was ‘stuff’.  I have a lot of stuff. It is not something that I am proud of but it seems to be something that is very hard to change. Making life changes no matter how small can be extremely difficult. With this many people get attached to the things they own causing a spike in your carbon footprint. The continuation of the cycle of frequent overbuying is a toxic trait for many today, including myself. I do believe that I could make the most impact on my carbon footprint in the ‘stuff’ category of my life. 
 <br><br>

The fact I found most frustrating in this video is the common argument of the ‘American Way’. A way of life we have coined to support excessive consumerism in the United States. America has a way of thinking “my way or the highway” and it has been instilled in us that we can do what we want and use what we want with no punishment. The simple fact that we cannot see the climate crisis happening before our eyes causes a wave of complacency that has overtaken people and does not allow for reality to set in. We must wake up, make changes, and make them now. The planet can not heal itself magically while we sit idly by and treat it exactly the same as before. The simple fact of the matter is if we don’t make changes now nothing good will come of it.

I found the lecture video “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?” to be extremely interesting. I have always wondered what we could do to help stop or slow down climate change and even though I already knew some of the suggestions, I found others to be surprising and doable as well. Being from Los Angeles I have realized that public transportation needs to be a lot better so that people use cars less. Trying to get somewhere that is only two miles away in LA can take up to twenty or thirty minutes when there is a ton of traffic. A lot of the times the cars driving around LA only hold two or three people but they take up so much space because they are in a huge car. Getting around in busses would decrease our carbon footprint, but it would also cut down the amount of traffic there is everywhere. Instead of thirty people in seven to eleven cars there could be thirty people in one bus. There are some people that will drive to a store that is not that far from their home, when it would be a lot better to take a bus or even bike there. A lot of the suggestions that Ken makes seem extremely do-able, I just don’t know if we can apply fast enough to save our planet. I was slightly surprised when Ken talked about how houses have gotten bigger even though families have gotten smaller. I knew some houses were bigger, but I didn’t know it was happening to this extent. I was upset watching Ken’s second lecture, “What the Boomer generation knew about the climate crisis - and when we knew it”, because they knew what could happen if they did not change what they were doing and they still decided not to do anything about it. Instead they left it for my generation to fix their mistakes, if it’s even possible at this point. They knew it was happening as early as 1854 and they still chose not to listen. Then, they were told again in 1956 that global temperatures would rise significantly in the 20th century as a result of the burning of fossil fuels. Knowing all of this information they decided to keep doing what they were doing and deal with the consequences later. Well, later is now.




</p><hr>


<p>

I think that the reason many people from past generations are unwilling to give up their big house and car is because they did not have those things growing up. They view those things as part of themselves and their achievements. It is a sense of pride to buy your first car or house. I think that for younger people this is less of an issue. They grew up in an era where having a car was normal, living in a house by yourself was normal, and we therefore do not value those things as much.



</p><hr>


<p>
In my previous knowledge of climate change I had never considered really more than using less and recycling more to help the cause on my part. Ken's explination of the ways we can actually help were very intriguing for me. Using public transportation, living in smaller housing,  transferring your eating habits to a plant based diet, and limiting yourself to one child are all actually very reasonable ways to reduce without making drastic changes to your lifestyle. I guess that is in my personal point of view as an Isla Vistonian. Here in IV we all live in small places and ride our bikes everywhere. We recycle and reduce plastic use by using reusuable water bottles and what not. 
 <br><br>
If we could only explain to the rest of the country that this life, a more simple life, is what needs to be implemented to achieve a healthier world for everyone here and not just themselves. Most people are consequently driven by selfish thoughts to better themselves and do not consider the effects it might have on others and our environment.

<p>

I really don't have much to say about our generation possibly failing at something that was failed many times before. This idea is very scary to me and I want to create change regarding the climate crisis Burt I fail quite often in finding concrete ways to do so. I struggle to see the change that I can create and foster just being an individual. I want to leave this comment to come back to after I have learned more about the effects that I can have as I do not feel to optimistic currently. I will return to explain how I've hopefully changed.

After these weeks' lectures and these videos describing what one generation can do to help with the climate change crisis, these five things that Ken presented were things that I have previously heard about doing and have actively been trying to do myself. The major thing that always leaves me in disbelief is the amount of food that is being wasted on a daily basis and the amount of carbon that is released in order for meat production. Switching over to a more plant-based diet is shown to be beneficial but I do believe that if we were more conscious of our intake of food and waste less food, there could be a better distribution and situation regarding the food. I do believe that even though we might take the action to better our footprint on the world, it will still be considered restricted by the wealth and those that oppose the idea that climate change is real, which can have an extremely negative impact. As Ken said in one of the class lectures, the rich and wealthier are more responsible for the level of carbon that is emitted back into the atmosphere and that the poor will suffer more than the wealthy during this climate crisis, which helps back up the fear that the older generation will pose as a block from advancing to a better and healthier method of actions.



</p><hr>


<p>
“What can I do to help?” I really liked how Ken initiates “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?” by asking a pretty straightforward question. Not only does he get right to the point, the five options that Ken gives to help mitigate climate change are quite straightforward as well. I reacted exactly just how he mentioned during the lecture. I am glad that I listened to this because, in all honesty, I didn’t know what I could do to help our planet. I used to have the mentality that I am just one individual and that my actions won’t matter in the long run. This class has helped me fix this mentality and become more open-minded. More importantly, when everyone has this toxic mentality, then there is nothing done for the issue at hand. When the topic of anthropogenic climate change is brought up, it is mostly to describe the drastic effects that are taking place. You rarely hear discussions that mention how to take on this problem head on. I definitely have started taking my everyday actions more into account in the sense of what I do and eat. I have never driven a car, and thanks to this class now, don’t really plan to as I want to minimize my carbon footprint as much as possible. When it comes to what I eat, I have started prioritizing certain vegetables and items that are more eco-friendly into the mix. I ultimately want to strive to acquire a flexitarian diet and to motivate others to do the same. These 5 steps seem impractical and meaningless at first, but when everyone is taking part in them, it affects our world in ways that we haven’t imagined. I now also know what to say when friends ask me how to combat this issue of anthropogenic climate change at hand.




</p><hr>


<p>
After watching the lecture videos, I realized that there are many habits I can change that can help reduce my carbon footprint on the Earth. As Professor Ken suggested, we can start with transportation. Although at UCSB I mostly bike or take the bus, back home my family uses cars as our main form of transportation. I have also heard of going vegan or plant based even though it can be difficult to cut off foods that I love. I think one of the most popular changes people have made is drinking a plant based milk instead of cow milk. In regards to shopping, I have heard of people reducing their use of plastic by bringing their own containers to grocery stores in order to avoid buying and wasting plastic. I think it is a habit that many people can do which will largely reduce our use of plastic.
 <br><br>
However, I believe that one of the suggestions made in the video would be difficult to achieve. Even though it would be helpful to move closer to the city, it is really expensive to find an affordable place to live in especially in the LA area. Many people tend to move away in order to find places that are affordable and it is especially difficult for low income families to find places that are cheaper and closer to the city. I do believe that everyone can make changes to their lifestyle to reduce their carbon footprint.




</p><hr>


<p>
In the past I thought that knowledge was power, but Ken pointed out in lecture that knowledge doesn't automatically mean action. It is important that people know the facts about climate change, but simply knowing is not going to change people's habits. I think that the main reason that older generations of Americans find it so difficult to change their lifestyles is because they don't want to change their ways because in a sense if they do, they are giving up their freedom. They believe that they are entitled to options and that they have worked hard to be where they are at. That means that they deserve that big house, to eat like a king, to drive the most luxurious cars, have however many kids they'd like, and shop for whatever they want. However, because younger generations see the importance of taking action we do not have the same privilege to turn a blind eye. I do think that some of the solutions proposed will be difficult to do, especially depending on ones culture. For example, there are places that rely on having huge families so the whole one child per person may not be as easy to do for some people. However, I do think that it is important for people to try and change their habits, because I know it won't be easy for everyone but in the end it is going to save the planet.

<p>
In my opinion, this is a much needed video for society as a whole because it reveals how a big cause behind out contribution to the climate crisis comes from our own selfish desire to want what is now considered bigger and better in American civilization. The "American dream" has been established to revolve around one's own greed, so many of these proposed ways to improve things are much easier said than done, but that absolutely does not mean that they are not possible. These suggestions practically propose a whole new way of living, which is what we actually need in order for there to be an effective change. Ken's generation appears to be much less accepting and understanding towards these propositions, where on the other hand our generation seems to be a lot more willing to put in the effort to make these changes and fix the mess that has been created and that is obviously getting worse everyday. I believe a big reason behind this is that Ken's generation has worked so hard to get to where they wanna be in life and enjoy the "luxuries" of life without realizing the negative effects that come with those "luxuries". They have grown through all those years to establish a mentality believing that certain materialistic things, especially an expensive lifestyle revolved around expensive cars, large homes, etc,  symbolize success and accomplishment in this society, even though they are partially the reason the society and our world is being threatened. In a way it is kind of understandable how stubborn his generation may be because they have invested so much time, money, and effort into the materialistic and luxurious lifestyle and they may just not want to reverse that hard work. Where on the contrary, many people of our generation still have a lot of space for change and improvement because we have not been on this earth as long as they have, therefore we have more time to look forward to. We have a greater desire and willingness to work towards a new lifestyle so that we actually have a life to look forward to.

This was probably my favorite lecture so far. Unlike past lectures, films, and readings, this lecture presented an opportunity for optimism. As Ken was talking about the typical reaction from his students, I felt proud to be part of my generation. It is very encouraging to hear that the majority of young people are willing, and even excited to do what it takes to reduce our carbon footprint, even when we are surrounded by older generations complaining away about how they are expected to change the way they live. The future is bright. I was also very interested in the five ways to reduce our carbon footprint that were presented, and I am definitely looking forward to hearing more about it later in the course. We have been dealing with a lot of heavy and stress-inducing material, so a lighter lecture like this was relieving. I am absolutely excited about learning more about what I can do help save the planet, and I'm sure the majority of my classmates are as well. I believe an attitude like this from younger generations is what will slow down the climate crisis before it makes the planet uninhabitable.

I also was relieved to hear that we can make a difference and that we do have the opportunity to turn this around, especially after all the scary articles and films that only focused on what's been done to put us and the earth in this position. I think it's important to realize what has been done and how large our human impact is so that we don't continue to make future mistakes in this manner, but it's also important to focus on what can be done to move forward. The five things that Ken explains in the lecture are things that are very doable, and I noticed that a lot of these things we already do by default of being college students. Many of us don't have cars because of the limited parking in Isla Vista, and the availability of public transport such as the free buses are of great use. UCSB is also very bike focused, making that the main form of transport of students who go from class to home. We also live in close quarters with each other; most live in dorms, students apartments, or houses with several other people in IV. The high prices of this city make it only realistic for cohabitation, which consequently reduces our carbon footprint. These two factors alone make up 1/2 of an individual's carbon footprint, and being a college student living in a college town greatly reduces that. The progressive nature of California also makes the other points such as going mainly plant-based and buying second hand things trendy rather than a chore like the older generation considers it.

In the lecture “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?” Ken addresses the generational divide among the issue of climate change. I really enjoy how Professor Hiltner always recognizes the different views generations have regarding climate change. I also appreciate how he acknowledges the lessons his generation did not learn from. I found all the information he presented in this particular lecture to be extremely useful and got a better understanding of what steps I can take to lower my carbon footprint. Some of the five suggestions Ken proposes in the lecture are important, easy changes we can make in our lives. While some suggestions like moving to a city or living in a micro-apartment aren't ideal, or accessible to everyone, I think it’s still a good suggestion for those who want to consider this in the future. Some of the suggestions Ken proposes in the lecture I had already heard of. Hasan Minhaj’s show Patriot Act, has an episode dedicated to fast fashion which has caused me to rethink my relationship with clothes. Through that particular episode, I learned how the average American throws away about 80 lbs of clothing every year, and how in 1980’s the average American bought about 12 articles of clothing and now that number has increased 60+ a year. I can’t say I was surprised to see how large the number was, but I immediately felt guilty for not considering how the production of these clothes negatively affected the planet. Hearing Ken's suggestions in regards to clothing made me feel a little better because those are some of the steps I have taken.  
 <br><br>

One thing about this course is that it has caused me to question my actions on a daily basis. Many of my actions concerning the suggestions made in the lecture video. I think it’s important for us to question our lifestyles. I appreciate Ken for making us question whether we are doing enough and suggesting new ways we can do more. Seeing more lectures with information with suggestions to help reduce my carbon footprint has been really useful to me.

After watching both of Professor Ken’s lecture videos, I was left with a lot of thoughts. The main one being: am I really doing enough to help our planet? I’ve been wanting to go fully vegetarian and eventually vegan for a long time and after watching this video, I’ve gotten more inspired to do so. Professor Ken lists some great ways we can all make a difference. Although it can seem demanding to some, if everyone took small steps to help reduce their ecological footprint, it can make a big difference like professor Ken says. I try my best to only buy what I need and thrift clothes, but in current society it can be hard to limit people from spending their well-deserved money. 
 <br><br>

Nowadays it’s all about having designer items and the newest shoes. We can all get wrapped up in these societal expectations and wants, but we forget about what this means for the our planet. Take for example, various celebrities like the kardasians with enormous houses, designer bags worth millions, and flying on their private jets. The negative impact this has on the environment is huge. Instead of promoting this lifestyle to the world, they should use their influence to promote a more eco friendly lifestyle. It doesn’t necessarily have to be extreme whatsoever. It can be as simple as cutting down on eating beef, replacing dairy products for vegan alternatives once a week, taking the bus more often if possible, using reusable bags, etc. What I’ve realized is it doesn’t take an immense amount of effort to make a change in our ecological footprint on Earth. Although it does require some effort, it ultimately ends up being worth it in the end.

Outside of our lecture's setting, I'm always posting climate-related events, sustainable ways to eat and live, the consequences of waiting too long to do something, and simply just advocating for a change in the way politicians take on climate change. Before taking this course I thought that there was a lot a person could do to mitigate the effects of climate change. I thought that recycling, buying less plastic, and using less waster and energy was the key to saving the planet's resources. I still do tell people to do these little things I just don't feel the same way about the impact they will have anymore, I feel that it's too late to simply change some of our habits and I really do hope that its not! I've just grown to be pessimistic about people and our consumer culture. We buy more than we need, order more than what we could consume, and use more water and electricity than we have to. Working at a dining common has made me change my ways of eating because I see how much food people waste. People will get 5 plates of food and only eat 2, I understand that we pay for our swipes and that its an all-you-can-eat place but at least finish your food or don't serve/buy as much! (: I still see people using water bottles, water bottles being sold and also not being disposed of properly. Luckily UCSB has recycling bins but people in my hometown and in other places either don't care or haven't gotten the memo that they should consume less plastic and styrofoam, and it's not entirely their fault if they're not educated but that's just another problem, that this climate crisis isn't being talked about enough for people to care and to change. Lights also stay on all the time too! Restaurants, schools, and plenty of other locations sometimes even have them on during the day and I think to myself "why can't you just turn them off and make use of the natural light during the day?". Even in my residence hall, I'm always turning off our laundry's and lounge's lights when they're not in use but I shouldn't have to; people should know this by now. People still haven't broken the habits they have, and I get it, its hard or whatever but I know that we have a lot of potential to do good, but also potential to ignore what's happening and continue to harm the planet with our gigantic carbon footprints.

Past generations want to know what to do to avert climate catastrophe but won't take accountability sometimes and just simply not take a stand as I've seen the "I'm gonna die anyway approach." We have the knowledge and see the effects, we just have to start inducing change and it's not easy, but steps forward matter. It is truly astounding to hear that past generations knew the damaging effects their behavior, but didn't care to do anything at that moment. Both of these lectures were enlightening, but it will take some serious change as people want to do whatever they see fit which comes from them having the privilege to do so since they may not feel immediate effects like certain islands or tropical areas. With the way things are going, it will get to a point where maintaining life on Earth will be difficult or near impossible due to excessive release of greenhouse gases and although it's been a gradual process over many decades it will one-day make people think "why didn't I change sooner?" or what could've been if the government took the proper steps to ensure our right of a clean future. It's their job to protect us, yet all they're doing is putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound.

I think it’s amazing how easy it is for many Americans  to take the initial steps to reduce their carbon footprint. Using more public transport? Living in smaller or greener houses? Reducing meat intake and don’t waste food? Have less kids? These are all incredibly easy steps. While many people may be financially unable to completely unroot their lives and move to a city or may be unable to afford “healthier” food, most people can do these things with ease. Adding solar panels, not wasting food, living less consumerist lives, and regularly using mass transport are all things that would additionally save people money in the long run. Having less children is incredibly easy due to modern birth control, and people who desire a larger family can take the option of fostering or adopting other children in this country who need loving homes. So you gain a family at the same time you give one. What on earth is the downside to that? We are so fortunate to live in a country where the majority of people are able to make choices like “have one child” or “don’t waste food” is even an option. This may contend with different cultural and religious traditions however; many religions encourage bigger families as it widens the “flock”. Buying less and buying pre owned is so cheap! Why would people not want to save money! And why would people not want to love with the knowledge that they are living simpler, more “in the moment” lives. These are such easy changes, I can not imagine how the suggestions are met with such resistance. Maybe if they were worded as “top 5 ways to save money!” people would listen more. Are we really that selfish, that we can’t give up a couple material pleasures or comforts to help humanity as a whole? 
  <br><br>
To clarify though, I am absolutely against villainizing the actions of common people vs. oil companies and the real culprits of climate change. I believe we have a moral responsibility to make whatever changes in our lives that we can and do our part to help. But shaming people for drinking a plastic gatorade they bought at 7-11 is not really getting at the main issue. In the end, it is too easy to get pulled into a vortex of climate guilt. We can not lose sight of the real enemies: the big corporations that profit off systems that kill our climate at a massive pace.

The solutions proposed in this video sound simple, but also seem very difficult to achieve. The main tradeoff in all of the solutions is this: ease of life vs long term climate impact. While most of the solutions do sound effective (if feasible), it may be hard for people to give up daily comforts that become engrained in their lifestyles. For example, giving up meat and going vegetarian would mean that people would have to change their diets completely. However, at this point, we as humans do not have the luxury to make decisions in favor of our own ease of life. We must consider the future generations – the ease of life for generations to come. It is important to consciously think about more environmentally friendly alternatives when making any decision – whether it come to buying clothes, driving, or eating as it will be the sum of these individual decisions that will lead to global change. For those who adopt the approach two way of thinking – it may be difficult for them selflessly, mostly because the major effects of climate change would occur after their lifetimes. However, this is a major misconception. Climate change effects are already here, and these effects need to be publicized so that people do not adopt this second way of thinking.

Hearing the five suggestions to cut our climate footprint makes it sound so easy to make a difference. Having the knowledge necessary to make a difference should give us the responsibility to act upon it. In Ken’s other video he explains how his generation was aware that our fossil fuel and meat consumption would be ruinous, yet no action to stop the danger was taken. Instead, profit and wealth were prioritized, creating the world we know today. To me, the five suggestions aren’t radical ideas at all. Meat consumption does seem to be a bigger issue because people don’t like being told we have to change our lifelong eating habit. Consumerism is also a tough issue. It seems we measure success and wealth with how much things we can buy. The best example is the fast fashion industry: people buy clothes like it’s disposable, but no one truly needs an overflowing closet of clothes. It’s wasteful. I often see on social media videos of celebrities doing closet tours, and all I can think of is “how can one person NEED all of that?” While people argue “let people do what they want with their hard earned money,” I think it’s childish to ignore the harm and consequences selfish consumerism has on the planet.

I really like this lesson because it actually provides methods to have positive impacts on the environment, and I’m pleasantly surprised that I am not terribly off the mark. I wouldn’t wish to become complacent though since I know there are definitely ways to improve. I take public transportation to school, I don’t eat red meat, I definitely do not have more than 2 kids, I share housing, and I keep all my clothing for years. What worries me though, like Ken said, is that not everyone shares my mentality. My own family dismisses my beliefs because it’s “trendy” to be environmentally friendly; they do not see it as a necessary change as I do. Perhaps with these simple steps it can be easier to convince anyone to make a simple change.

As established by Hiltner in this lecture, I was genuinely surprised about how easy potential options for reducing my carbon footprint are. Obviously me alone isn't going to have enough impact to have any significant difference, but I still do acknowledge that, by me making the switch, I can coerce people into following suit and doing the same. A funny thing to realize is that society is gearing modern society into a more urban-like life style anyways. Minimalist apartment living seems to be the norm for almost the entire US population below the age of 30.  I feel like a small change for almost all of us can do extraordinary things to the world.  
   <br><br>
In terms of the generational topic, I can actually see why the point of view from the older generation is the way that it is. Older people naturally seem to be more stringent in their ways, often not letting their ideas be swayed by other opinons. Because their ideas and perceptions have already grown for the past decades, their perspectives are probably significantly harder to alter. Of course, this is natural. I also understand how someone significantly younger (and supposedly less wise) telling the older generation what they can/can't do could be slightly offensive to some.

<p>
From this lecture, I agree with the professor and realized that the nature of our economy is one of the main reasons why our planet is suffering from abundant amount of damages. People are too busy consuming on what they want, which is probably causing negative effects on our environment. However, while some people may be aware of this issue, many people go through their daily lives committing actions that are causing damages without being aware. I think it is time where people should reflect on their actions because if they don't do it now, who knows what will happen in the future. We won't be able to have a home and although that seems dramatic, it is certainly possible. Today's generation is also in fault because we are focused and used to the comfort we have everyday. Now we must figure out together how to replace our greedy comfort with something sustainable for the environment. Although achieving all 5 of Ken's suggestions may be difficult for many people, taking small steps at a time to achieve each goal would be taking a big step toward saving our planet.

While I am all for doing my part in combating the climate crisis, not everyone cares as much or is able to change as much as I can. And that is where my problem lies with the solutions you have provided for us. All of them are highly impractical for a majority of Americans, and in some cases a majority of humans. I'd like to preface what I am about to say with that I agree that downsizing your home is a great opportunity to reduce your carbon footprint. Out of all of the solutions you provided, this is one that I believe could actually be implemented, especially with the surge in popularity in tiny homes and minimalism. I also agree that reducing the amount of children you have is another viable way to combat climate change. But getting rid of your car, moving to an Urban area, and eating a plant based diet is too much to ask of the entire population. People are unwilling to change.
   <br><br>

Getting rid of your car and the problems that come with it seem to be exasperated by the way cities are planned in America. Due to the large quantity of land available to us, American cities are designed to be horizontally stretched out, unlike other developed nations who tend to build upwards. The large distances between areas in our country makes getting rid of your car almost impossible, with some people commuting upwards of 100 miles a day. While America could invest in better public transportation like our European and Asian counterparts, the sprawling nature of American cities also makes this nearly impossible to make it efficient enough to justify the cost. So instead of getting rid of cars, maybe investing in electric cars and requiring older cars to be updated every so often with new catalytic converters and such would be a better option. 
   <br><br>

Cities are extremely expensive to live in, and it is just not possible to cram everyone into a city before climate change has gone too far.
   <br><br>

Switching your diet has proven to be the hill that many people will die on. Even knowing the torture the animals are put through, and the effects cultivating livestock has on the environment, most people are unwilling to change. While I commend those who have switched to plant based diets and recognize the impact their making, I hardly see ending the meat industry as we know it as a viable solution. Instead we could try focusing on reducing the amount of methane cows release into the atmosphere by changing their diets or something else that can reduce the impact the meat industry will always have on the planet.




</p><hr>


<p>

I believe the culture of individualism, the concept of fighting for yourself and for freedom, is also the reason that attracts people to American all over the world. These people include international students such as me and immigrants. I somehow feel that these people may feel more difficult to give up those things, because "to live in a big house, own a fancy car" is what they come for. 
   <br><br>

Another problem I observe among our generation is the existence of materialism, which is related to what I just wrote. I grew up in a city and I am already very comfortable with living in apartments with others and taking public transportations. But when I am here, what I notice is that taking buses and subways is seen for the poor and homeless, definitely not for the middle and upper-class people, especially in L.A. Since I don't have a car, when I was interning in L.A. last summer, I commuted every day by bus for a total of 2 hrs. When I suggested my friend, who doesn't own a car either, to join me, he gave me a strange look and chooses uber.

I found the subtle discussion of extreme self entitlement embedded within patriotism very interesting pertaining to the reactions of older generations to the idea of cutting self indulgence back for the sake of the greater good. I think some fail to understand that our societal American ideals are not linear or static, what we find important in our society and the social constructs we are taught should continue fluidly instead of strict guidelines to keep forever. Much of our taught morals and ideals are strict to context but at the end of the day we are always learning. It seems to me that older generations fail to think outside of the constructs they were taught mostly pertaining to goals of American patriotism. American patriotism throughout history has taught Americans, primarily those of older generations, to focus on valuing wealth, abundance of material objects induced from self indulgence, and that we should be working our butts off to find success in these values through entitlement. Since older generations are left engraved to uphold these values, they largely reject any change or progression with the ideals they grew up to serve such as capitalism and entitlement. Thus, its harder for someone of your generation to buckle down and “sacrifice” their indulgences that they believe only they should be entitled to, like it is owed to them. I also the idea of housing rearrangement as a solution to global warming made me think about the housing crisis in Oakland right now and the overwhelming spread of homelessness. I figure if it was more common to live in smaller, more equal spaces rather than huge unnecessary homes the homeless population would decrease due to more space and availability for access to housing. Instead of taking up masses of land creating huge 1-family homes, there would be more economically friendly complexes made to adjust to a more minimalistic future.




</p><hr>


<p>
We have to rethink our entire society to change. We revolve our lives with the materialistic and focus on what other people have and not what is actually important. When it comes down to it, the biggest cause of the climate crisis is overconsumption. The fossil fuels that are burned into the environment are either burned by people themselves or by corporations producing things for people to buy or use. Like Ken suggested in reducing our carbon footprint, we don't need cars or buy new clothes all the time, it is just not practical or a necessity. As for the lifestyle changes such as changing to a plant based diet, it is important for people to understand that what they eat impacts the environment and for the one child thing it is another step to reduce consumption on planet earth. All of these suggestions are eco friendly and in the long run will save you money and even better--save the environment. If the new generation implements and lives by these suggestions we will be able to curtail the impending climate doom and hopefully restore our planet.

I thought this video would be a simple instructional guide to on how to reduce one's carbon footprint but instead included some steps that are often times out of one's control or not as simple as it sounds. The 5 steps mentioned in the video are: have less kids, waste less food/plant based diet, move to city, stop driving, and buy less goods. Though simple at first glance, when actually trying to change some of these factors it can been seen that there are obstacles such as religion, culture, necessity causes that will contribute to global warming. I believe these are the end goals for everyday people to do in order to stop global warming but this jump would simply be too much and discourage people to not want to try and help. Some of the 5 steps seem unreasonable as not everyone could simply move to a city because of many financial and career obstacles and the other main one being not driving because of how people need to go to work and do miscellaneous errands. One other point that I personally think would be too much of a private matter is limiting the children of a family because I believe that it is the choice of the family in how many children they want to support and raise. That is why I believe the final 2 points are what should be focused on because they are more doable and still have a large impact on the environment. Just beef in food manufacturing counts for 1/4 of methane in the atmosphere and an unbelievable 1/3 of all food made is wasted. The fashion industry is the same with fast fashion accounting for large portions of greenhouse gases and with large amounts of the clothes thrown away after oftentimes not even a year.

The "American Lifestyle" has to be one of the most entitled concepts in the world. To believe that your right is to have whatever you want, when you want it, at whatever cost it takes; mindblowing. 
   <br><br>
As Ken mentioned in this video, a change can be brought by completing 5 steps, 4 which I believe to be extremely possible. The first one would be to reduce the meat you consume. Many people are determined to keep eating their steaks and burgers and refuse the idea to become vegetarian or vegan. What they don't understand is that by simply reducing the amount of meat they consume, they could drastically cut down on the carbon emissions being released. It simply takes a conscious mind to realize that one does not need to eat red meat daily, especially if they know or hear about the damage it causes. 
   <br><br>
The only step I am not 100% sure about would be the housing proposal. Yes, people should live in smaller homes, but I don't believe they should be concentrated in a city. This step could have many side effects and backfire.

I completely agree with your statement that the "American Lifestyle" is one of the most entitled concepts in the world. This concept is what has contributed the most to greenhouse gas emissions and it is frustrating that we (those who don't adopt the "American Lifestyle") are associated with it simply because we are on American soil. I also agree with your idea that people need to learn to consume less. But the problem is that not enough people are educated on how much impact minimal consumption will have on climate change reduction.

While listening to this video, I couldn’t help but think about the artist Peter Menzel and his project on families and their houses around the world. Menzel is a photographer who traveled to different countries to take pictures of families and all of their belongings outside of their houses. His project Material World: A Global Family Portrait had helped me put into perspective how different families lived in comparison depending where they lived. The US unsurprisingly had large households with more valuable looking furniture, toys, and other stuff. Families in the US were also smaller compared to others. Based on this, I agree with Ken on the fact that the amount of consumption, family size, housing, etc. are big actors in carbon footprints and should be better managed or controlled. On the other hand, many people around the globe cannot make the same steps in reducing carbon footprints as they rely on different factors for living such as reliability on more children for more labor work to gain more income. Foodwise, individuals are also limited to food they may locally grow or have accessibility to. While things can be done today by oneself, it is important to find ways in which more people globally can apply their similar steps based on their situations. For example, implementing more and better education, especially for women, will help family planning because the more education one has allows them to develop a family later in their lives as well as conceiving less children.

I feel somewhat guilty after hearing how we can reduce our carbon footprint, significantly while at it. The biggest problem that I would have is that I really enjoy eating meat. I grew up within a culture in which eating meat is bound to happen - tacos of cow tongue, beef, pork, and many more. There are plenty of dishes that I've grown up eating that it's too hard for me to give up, simply because I view it as leaving my culture behind. 

   <br><br>

I can easily deal with buying less, walking and using public transportation to places, and (in the FAR future) not produce too much offspring. The housing can be also dealt with, seeing as how it's expensive enough already as it is to live in California, most people realistically won't be able to afford really big homes, seeing as how the middle class is slowly diminishing, and would move towards apartments. I've seen many apartment complexes being built, which in a sense can be viewed as progress towards reducing land space usage. 

   <br><br>

The part(s) that most Americans would have an issue would be eating no meat and buying less. Fast food has become a staple in American diets, which would cause many Americans in struggling to remove that aspect from their way of life. I know I would definitely struggle in getting rid of Big Macs and bacon cheeseburgers from my diet. It's a tough choice to make, but it's one that we as a collective need to do in order to make a change. Even if you can't fully give up meat, try to reduce your consumption.

Watching the lecture videos, I felt almost a sense of accomplishment knowing that I actively did all of the things that Ken had mentioned. I wish I had the abilities to convince my friends, family, and peers to do the same. I was glad that my parents have always educated me on climate change, with taking me to museums and talking about extinctions or aquariums and talking about pollution. I had the understanding that global warming and climate change was a real issue all my life. As I got older, I came to the realization that there were so many people out there who were either climate change deniers or just felt completely hopeless about the situation. This shocked me, as I thought it was more of a fact than opinion. The common argument that I hear in my peers is that there is no point in changing the way you live because not everyone is going to change their lifestyle. However, the issue is that everyone thinks that. Instead of thinking that way, I hope more people will start thinking in terms of how they really can make a difference. Most think that it’s too late but it’s not. We need to step up and do what other generations failed to do and take action.

As I watched the mini lecture “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?”, I was quite appalled at the 5 interesting solution Ken discussed. I'd like to lead off by saying these are legitimate options for those looking to reduce their carbon footprint and do their part to saving their planet. People live in houses they simply cannot afford, and food is indeed wasted at an alarming rate. That being said, there are so practical shortcomings to these methods. Method one says take alternate modes of travel such as bikes or public transportation rather than drive. In certain cases that would be the preferred method, such as in IV. A lot of people drive to work or are uncomfortable using public transportation alone, especially at night and in urban areas. Method two suggest people live in more eco-friendly locations such as urban areas or  co-housing communities. Though this might be a feasible option for some, I doubt people would want to live in such close quarters to other, especially when they have the means to do otherwise. That being said, house sizes are too big to be sustainable at the moment, and a priority on eco-friendly housing construction should be a top priority to home buyers and the state. Method three suggests eating less meat and switching to a more plant based diet. In this regard, I absolutely agree. Method four suggests limiting offspring to one child per couple. In regards to this, I think families and the population should be fully informed about the topic and the potential long term environmental effects, but I do believe the choice is ultimately up to them. Finally, method five suggests we buy less "stuff" and Ken is absolutely right. America has instilled a consumerist culture within the population and have subsequently been geared to constantly buy new items, whether it be clothing or otherwise. Cutting out unnecessary purchases is a major step we as a nation have to take to stop this impending crisis.

We are hardly making any effort to reverse climate change now, how would the last generation be fully aware of the threat and preparing to combat the climate change? 
    <br><br>
  Anyways, I am glad that the issue of climate change has become widely known, and though some solutions are radical, many are manageable. For example, converting to vegetarian or vegan, or simply cutting down meat consumption if you wish to, or consuming insects, which are full of protein too, and their carbon trail is much less than that of a cow or a sheep; use public transportation, recycle what you have used, adopting children, the list goes on. 
     <br><br>
 The climate deniers emphasize on the loss of freedom as we start adapting to this new lifestyle. Many people think that they won’t be able to enjoy life anymore. That is a very silly thing to say. We strive for luxurious things at the cost of the environment, and most of time they are not necessary to one’s life. Adapting close to a minimalistic lifestyle is very enjoyable and healthy, and people shouldn’t be afraid of it.

I had the same response that you had just said many of students of my generation had: "This doesn't sound too bad" and "oh really is that is?" It's scary how predictable our generations are (both old and young.) What's even more scary is how different they both are. It make's me think how did we get such a big generational gap in ideas? I've talked to my parents, grandparents, and other older family members about climate change, and what i have noticed is a trickle in influence from me to the older generations. My parents wont listen to me but they will listen to my older brother, My parents can influence their uncles/aunts, and my uncles/aunts can influence my grandparents. I am not sure if other's people have this hierarchy of  influence in their family but at least for me, the way I am changing the older generation is by trickling information through this type of familial ladder. Maybe the young generation is too far off to change the old, rather it might help to work our way up the generational gap rather than try to take too far of generational leaps?

Ken’s lecture, “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?,” highlights five ways Americans can reduce their greenhouse emissions. These include taking public transportation, moving to a smaller apartment, reducing food waste and the amount of meat eaten, having smaller families, and thrifting your clothes. These are all simple ways we can help combat the climate crisis, but because some involve major lifestyle changes, many are reluctant to partake in said changes. They would rather live luxuriously then make these sacrifices to save our planet. We have known about the effect our consumer lifestyles would have on the planet for decades, but we chose to continue living them rather than make these important changes.

It is one thing to believe in the climate crisis and another to do something about it. In the “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do ?” video I think Ken points out good ways in which we could reduce are carbon footprint from now. I think it is very helpful to hear about actions as individuals we can take now instead of waiting around until the government passed down restrictions and laws regulating the emissions of greenhouse gasses emitted by fossil fuel industries. It was surprising that pointed out the benefits to moving to a city since I had not thought about how the commuting and housing in cities could reduce an individual's carbon footprint. I do see that we do waste a lot of food which can be seen everywhere,even at the dining commons and I agree we need to be more conscious on the amount of food we waste. 
     <br><br>
In the “ What the Boomer generation knew about the climate crisis and when we knew it” I was surprised to hear that people knew as early as the 1970s what lifestyle choices contributed to a crisis such as the large consumption of meat, but still refused to change. It is crazy to think that in 1956,physicist Gilbert Plas  predicted that the effects of carbon would lead to major changes in temperature in the twenty century which it did. It makes me wonder if a prediction nearly 6 decades was true what about various statements painting a grim future will become a reality of things continue the way they are.

My hometown is a suburb, and although I did not live in one of the "McMansions" Ken mentions, I would say my house was slightly larger than average. I feel like I saw the worst of people's ignorance to their carbon footprint: expensive cars usually with bad gas mileage, massive mansions with a large plot of land, and frequent hour-long trips to the beach where trash littered the sand. I was a vegetarian and vegan in high school, and did little things to watch my footprint. I still remember some of my peers making fun of me for thinking my actions would do anything. I'm sure this was more to get on my nerves, but I also believe these people had no idea how much waste and pollution they produce. Trying to cut down on the trash I produced, shopping at thrift stores, and removing meat from my diet was what I felt I had the power to do at the time, and I regret not standing up for those practices when I got teased about them a little. I could have planted a seed in someone's mind and maybe later in life they'd consider a similar lifestyle as I was living.

<p>
After watching "Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?", I began to feel hopeful. The first few lecture videos and documentaries that we had to watch made me feel like we were doomed. The way that Ken talked about the 5 ways that we can reduce our carbon footprint were very simple and seemed like they are very accessible to all people. Although it might not be tomorrow when enough people start doing these 5 things to make a big difference, it is certainly something that could happen within the next 5 years. Even if not everyone perfectly executes these practices right away, it would still make a significant difference. When talking about how much food we waste, that is something that I have noticed on our very own campus. In the dining halls, they throw away so much food at the end of the day and its truly sad. We need to find a better way to discard of all the wasted food by possibly giving it to be people who need it or allowing other residents of Isla Vista/upper classman who don't usually eat in the dining halls have access to it after. Thrift shopping is now "trendy" which is a good step forward towards a smaller carbon footprint. Referring to how many older Americans react to these ideas, many Americans want a very lavish life, but freedom will not mean anything when our planet is dying, having the nicest house or car does not create a truly happy life. Maybe we all should downsize as it will humble us.




</p><hr>


<p>
I have huge hopes and expectations for my generation. I really believe that we can make significant changes and create a better environment for all of us.
     <br><br>
There are many who follow the environmentally-friendly lifestyle, and more are going to be practicing it. 
     <br><br>
In my opinion, I feel like it is so much easier to just have fewer clothes: you barely ever have to think about what to wear, you don't have to spend so much time shopping trying to find something that matches something else, and so many more reasons. A small apartment is also a lot better than a huge mansion-- less expensive taxes, less time spent on cleaning, easier to control, etc. All these changes are so convenient and advantageous that it would not be very wise to not make them. 
     <br><br>
Most of my friends, for example, already made several changes to their lifestyles and are aware of most of the suggested changes. They apply them to their lives and spread them to others, which can be very helpful since such information is not being communicated to the general public from where they are from. And this is exactly what we need right now -- the rapid spread of helpful and useful information that provides facts and solutions.

I do believe that we generation can make a better world. Ken mentions plenty of ways for environmentally-friendly life style like wasting less meat and using less cars. People can bike more and drive less. Biking produce zero pollution, and at the same time, it helps people becoming healthier. I really like the design of bike lane in Santa Barbara. Bike lanes make biking safe so that many people will choose this healthy lifestyle. Also, Ken talks about the land use for housing in states, people are now preferring bigger houses. While in Japan, people build only 1/10 size of housing compared to American ones. Avoiding unnecessary waste seems small, but it actually means a lot for the environment. In ken’s generations, many people hold opposite opinions towards life styles. For them, they work so hard just for buying fancy cars and shopping. They think it is quite normal for them to spend what they have earned. The old generations might not realize climate crisis because of lack of education about the global warming, but we should not ignore this problem. Let’s begin our environmentally-friend lifestyles!

In the video “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do '' there are 5 main ways everyone can do today in order to save our future. They are ;use more public transportation, live in more eco-friendly housing, eat food that doesn't have too much carbon emission, have less children, and generally purchase less new and consider pre owned. Although all these solutions are completely possible asking everyone to fulfill these to the max is ridiculous. I fully agree that we should all fully help in saving the planet but living like this is nearly impossible. Why should we live a shell of our lives for a problem that was expedited rapidly way before we were even born. Whenever I can, I try to use a more eco friendly transportation such as biking or the bus but sometimes it's just not possible. For example when I have a short period of time for vacation and I want to go to a far location a boat that would take much longer than a plane is not a viable option for me. As for the food, the option of only eating lentils , albeit its an extreme case of saving the planet, is impossible. Humans cannot survive on only that. The one that I can fully embrace is the less children. Lots of people nowadays are having way too many children that not only can they not handle but neither can the planet handle. It's a long way away but I won't have 10 kids. 
     <br><br>

In the second video the quote “if acted upon, knowledge is power” really resonated with me. Just because you know something doesn't mean it'll be of any use to you. We need to act on our knowledge of climate change and pave the road for the earth of tomorrow.

<p>

I'm glad that we're able to cut our carbon footprint to almost half. I really hope that if we all start to commit to these new changes, that others will become confident to follow. I know that I used to be careless about where my food comes from and where my trash goes. Yet, starting this year, I began to notice with my friend's family that they do so much to combat the degradation of the planet. Along with all the lifestyle changes in this video, they even go as far as cleaning the dirty plastics in order to recycle them. I feel subpar to the amount of stuff they do for our environment. In recent months, I find little things to add on to my lifestyle that would help reduce my carbon print, and I find pride in it. Of course, all my actions come with the satisfaction that I am doing something good for humanity in the end. Even with all the pessimism, I can do my part, and it can only spread from there.

I found this lecture video actually very helpful. The reason is because a lot of times I think of the danger of climate change and how far we’ve already destroyed our planet. It’s because of how far gone we are that makes it almost impossible to think that any changes in my life could make a difference. Not in a pessimistic way but in a “I feel helpless” way. 
     <br><br>

The reality of climate change and the fact that it’s already upon us is overwhelming so it’s even more so trying to think of ways to even start the process of fixing it. This video both reassured and informed me that if a large enough group of people begin to make these day to day changes, they’re outcomes can be monumental. While my reactions throughout the lecture were positive it also brought more worry in a sense because I thought to myself “if people haven’t already made these miniscule changes what’s to say my generation will commit themselves to change?” Simply because my generation is younger does not mean we have left the antiquated mind sets behind. Just as Ken pointed out and predicted, there will be those who refuse to be uncomfortable for a bit so as to benefit the “greater good” and those who see it as a great inconvenience. It did nevertheless still leave me with hope that we can make progress now that more and more people are opening their eyes to the issue at hand.

I found it interesting that bigger cities would be a hub for where individual person's carbon footprint would be less since my idea of bigger cities is also a hub of smog and bad pollution. I suppose that even though each individual person's carbon footprint is less, when you pile millions of people into a smaller area, that must have a pretty large summation effect compared to smaller, less urban areas where the carbon footprint is higher per person but there's not as many people and much more area to spread that bad atmosphere. I strongly agree with your talking about our society's perception on "stuff". I feel that that is the easiest of your five tips to actually live by. I also feel that all your tips for lowering your carbon footprint are also ways to just...save money. Take public transport/bike/walk, don't have to pay gas or pay car insurance. Live in an apartment, cheaper rent (depending on where you live), lowered utility costs. Shop secondhand or just shop less, obviously going to save some bank. Switch to plant-based diet, much cheaper because meat is EXPENSIVE and as long as you avoid boujie overpriced vegan products, it's healthy and can be easier. And obviously, not having kids can save you hundreds of thousands dollars. So taking these tips and comparing them to climate denialist's favorite argument of "it's too expensive to save the environment", it just makes them seem, for lack of better or kinder words, stupid.

In the video “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do”, Ken mentioned about five things to cut climate footprint: Less car use, more efficient housing, waste less food, have no more than one child per person and buy less. I knew that using less car and wasting less food would do good to climate, but another three things never occurred to me until I watch this video. We may say that, oh just five things, easy to do. However, it is easier said than done. Those five things are main parts of our lives, it is not easy for us to do. When I go grocery shopping, I remember not to use plastic bags, but I never thought about driving no car, because it will be too inconvenient. Even though sometimes we can not avoid doing it, I still believe that we should try our best instead of pretending it is okay not doing it. Our generations should not put burdens to the earth as previous generations.

<p>

I'm feeling more confident in the future of the world after watching these two videos because I feel we are finally acting upon the knowledge that we have had for decades. The only reason we didn't actually act upon in the past was because of delayed-effect(as specified in past lectures). I feel as if this feeling of a need to change is sparking throughout my generation. If this feeling were to continue throughout our generation then I am confident that we are going to rebound from the problem of climate change and learn from our past generation. However, I am worried that this period of activism will die down after students grow older and start worrying less about the future. Humans, especially coming of age adults, are very busy. We have to keep track of our jobs and our families, and I feel like we say now that living in a small space is easy and taking public transport is easy but I have doubt that that will continue in the future. We say these things because we live in dorms or houses with multiple roommates and can't afford to have a car, but as we age there is a strong possibility that we want luxuries from the work we have done. I'm not saying this to be dreary, I just hope we aren't going to grow out of wanting change in the world just as many of the people in the past generations have. 
     <br><br>
One thing that I am sure will rattle us even if we do grow out of this want for change and this action on our knowledge is direct ramifications from climate change that are obvious and undeniable. Somehow, as we've learned in the movie and book, there are people that deny climate change still. Having something happen that is undeniable the result of climate change will hopefully scare people into changing their habits and following the five things that you listed. I just hope that we aren't going to get to the point where the sign that climate change is real, is also the sign that it's too late.

I think Ken is very accurate in his assessment that previous generations have passed on the ideals of the “American lifestyle” and the concept of “bigger is better”, making it a bit more difficult for our generation to make the transition into the more sustainable lifestyle that he describes in the lecture. If you are taught when growing up that a big house and a fancy car and many material possessions are the measure of your success, it is difficult to redefine what you think the perfect lifestyle is. Changing this narrative and promoting a new concept of a what a successful lifestyle looks like could play a huge role in helping future generations move to a sustainable lifestyle. We are already seeing the effects of this with the vegan/vegetarian movement, which has created this image of a vegan/vegetarian lifestyle as being trendy and healthy, causing so many people to take part in it. If this approach could be applied to transportation, housing, and consuming, I believe that we would see a much rapider shift to a new lifestyle. 


     <br><br>

It is also comforting to know that despite what we were taught, many people within my generation look upon this transition as a positive and exciting venture. The fact that so many people are willing to make changes and take action is a spark of hope among all of the negativity that comes along with this crisis. We can only hope that my generation’s changes will be enough to convince our preceding generations to make changes as well.

If a pencil symbolized the timeline of planet Earth, human life would be the very tip of the lead pencil. In the time that humans have been here, more goods have been consumed than every past generation since 1950 altogether. I have decided to take a local approach to America’s disposable lifestyle by thrifting. I define thrifting as an activity by which one buys virtually everything except food from a second-hand source. Originally, I saw thrifting as an alternative to spend excess money on clothing, furniture, and gifts. I could be creative with my purchases by turning pants into shorts, rompers into tube tops, or tablecloths into curtains. I have created a business to share the phenomenon with even more people. Using Instagram as my platform, I model, sell, and deliver clothing pieces that I handpick at thrift stores. With thrifting comes patience, and I give my customers the ease of having second-hand items without the hassle of shuffling through items in-store. I have gained a following of almost 500 followers and have influenced a large number of my friends to be more conscious of their purchases and be aware that on-brand clothing is not everything. The positive feedback I received encouraged me to start a bigger movement at my old high school and collaborate with my science teacher for a school-wide Goodwill Drive for Earth Day. A pool party was awarded to the class with the heaviest item sum. This encouraged healthy competition for students to donate items to a good cause. 
     <br><br>
By supporting local thrift stores, we break the chain of clothes being sent to underdeveloped countries in bulk, destroying their textile industries and leaving many unemployed. It truly is another level of motivation that I get when thinking about the ways I personally can help to resolve this issue. I have made the decision to completely thrift everything and my hope is that others see the mutualistic system that it creates and join the movement. This change starts on a local level and thrifting redirects American consumerism to be less ecologically harmful and more holistically beneficial. It is powerful to know I have the ability to influence individuals to rewrite history by making sustainable choices one thrifted item at a time.

After viewing the lecture video, "Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?," Ken elaborates how our generation and new ones can collectively adopt a better lifestyle that would significantly help counter climate change that previous generations have neglected to embrace. In particular, Ken's suggestion of decreasing consumerism really resonated with me as I've also notice that within our society, the ideology of having more means have a better quality of general well being. This consumer line of thought is rather prevalent in older generations and is being ingrained in newer age groups. I hope that classes, like English 23, really educate younger people that living in superfluity isn't essential and unhealthy for the planet. I complete agree with Ken that refraining from purchasing unnecessary goods and avoiding a life of excess is important for the betterment of our planet and is generally healthier for people. We don't need a 4000 sq. ft. mcmancsion or the newest cars and clothes to live, but we do need a stable environment to survive, which is a sacrifice I'm willing to make and I hope that many others are will too.



</p><hr>


<p>
To a younger generation, many of these suggestions are very appealing changes to make in their lifestyles.  I agree with this point made in the lecture very much so.  Growing up, I noticed it became "trendy" to shop at thrift stores to achieve a "vintage" look; "thrifting" at the local Goodwill is now something cool and affordable to do with your friends in high school.  
     <br><br>

As I've transitioned into a university setting, I'm faced with more choices to make myself.  I find myself opting for a more plant-based diet, only meat 2-3 days out of the week.  I choose to walk or use public transportation to get anywhere I need to and as a first-year, the residence halls are the ultimate way I challenge myself to reduce my carbon footprint by sharing my living space with at least two other girls and greatly reducing what I buy and waste.  Seeing as many UC students aim for high-powered careers, in theory, we will truly only have the time and energy to raise 1-2 children as we balance a professional career and home-life.
     <br><br>

These are all things I've seen many college students do as they transition into adulthood and I am confident most of these habits will be continued long after they leave school to start their lives and keep reducing their carbon footprint.  I sincerely believe in my generation to do what previous generations failed to do.




</p><hr>


<p>

After watching Ken's lecture video, "Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?", I feel as though it'll be hard for a majority of our generation to make big lifestyle changes such as diet changes (plant-based) and energy choices. Even though a lot of us have the knowledge that these life style changes can make a big impact on slowing down the effects of climate change, many of us will still be complacent and not make any changes. This is partly due to the fact that climate change seems to be far in the future for a lot of us. This should continue to change though, as natural disasters become more and more prevalent and dangerous. More people will be personally affected by climate change and be moved to make more drastic changes to their lifestyles. 
     <br><br>


Similarly, most people won't be open to the idea of carbon taxes, as they won't immediately benefit from the implementation of them. Instead, they'll lose more money, and a recurring theme in this course so far seems to be the valuing of immediate money over long term benefits. I hope our generation can do what the previous generations couldn't. We grew up in this crisis and were given the knowledge needed to fight it. We have the opportunity to make big change, and we'll see if this generation is up to the task in the next 10 years.



</p><hr>


<p>
I believe todays generation will make significant strides towards building a better environmental future for generations to come, especially when compared to past generations. I don't believe that our generation will be the end all be all to the climate crisis. As generations in the past have seen, people get comfortable. 
     <br><br>
I see so many people doing one or more of the five things that Ken suggested people do in order for them to reduce their carbon footprint, however I have come across only a select few people who are aware enough, educated enough, and willing enough to live with four or five of these suggestions in mind on a day to day basis. This is the sad reality that I have seen and I don't believe it is that I have not crossed paths with enough people that I see things in this light. I believe it is that past generations have taught us to be like this creating a positive feedback loop of always wanting more. A cycle I think will take multiple generations to just stop and multiple more generations to reverse.

After watching this mini lecture, I have a clearer idea of what to do about the climate change. There’re five big solutions the professor mentioned, transportation, housing, food, children and relationship to stuff. Nowadays, the American Dream often refers to “the bigger the better” or “the more the better”. But this is not suitable for modern society. Before we take actions, the very first thing to do is to believe we have the ability to make a change. If we ourselves, college student of this generation don’t even have the faith, then we’re doomed. For me, I don’t think I need a car currently. I always use bus to go shopping or eating. But for the fifth point, that really make me rethink about my relationship to stuff. Fast fashion is now a very popular concept. And I like the satisfaction when I get new clothes or shoes. Recently, after taking classes in the university, I realize that it’s better to buy less and use longer. And I believe my generation will not make the mistakes of the past, as a boomer.

I appreciate the clear presentation of easy steps for people to take. I've always been daunted by the idea of trying to reduce my footprint because it has always seemed too vague an issue. However, since being enrolled in this class, I have felt much more capable of making individual changes to help the environment. For example, I have stopped eating red meat/dairy or any other cow products in recent weeks because that is a small change that can make a big difference. The simplification of steps for people to take is vital in avoiding the issue of Tragedy of the Commons. When people don't know what change to make they justify their lack of change by saying "I am just one person, it won't make a difference" But when the steps are shown in such a succinct, clear way, it seems a lot more manageable. I've always associated big cities with increased levels of pollution so I was shocked to hear that moving to a city helps reduce one's footprint. But it actually makes a lot of sense: it eliminates the "need" for a car and prevents people from owning unnecessarily large homes. I think in the years to come I will be able to fully adopt a plant based diet. I do wish that the government would stop subsidizing meat and dairy industries though because that allows those products to be much cheaper than their plant based alternatives. I think it is imperative that more videos like this are spread because they facilitate individual action. I share videos like this with my family with the hope that they take these steps as well because it really does seem easy when presented like this. As far as the cultural shift aspect goes, I think it will be very difficult to reduce the consumerism in the United States considering that for the past century America has subsisted upon it. Industries are reliant on the frenetic purchasing of goods by consumers so they continue to churn out short term, unsustainable products that will be bought and thrown away shorty after. To be honest,  I am not quite sure how this change will be able to be put in place but I wholeheartedly hope that it is.

After finishing with Ken’s mini-lecture, “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?”. I am just very glad that I still have a lot of opportunities to protect the environment anyway. Though my power or influence is still small and maybe can not do anything for the environment but produce a lot of CO2 every day. But I could still have some impact on the environment.
     <br><br>
As a Chinese, I agree with Kenn strongly on the side of birth control. From Kenn’s perspective, in his generation, there are only 3 billion people in 1959. However. Right now, for my generation, there are 7,7 billion people in the world. Such as my hometown, Shenyang, which is on the northeastern side of China, is having 3 million people. What my parents always said is that the fresh air and the blue sky that they had when they are young does not exist. Yes, our earth cannot hold so many people right now.
     <br><br>
Consequently, in order to fix that problem. Having birth control is the best way to figure the problem out. Like the Chinese government that I proud of forever, they published the policy for nearly 20 years ago. My country has forecast the problem and prevent catastrophe happen. Therefore, keeping on having birth control will be the best way for people to separate the limited resource positively.

This video is really helpful of providing useful guidance to people who want to pay effort to the changing climate. We human beings are always expensing too many new resources and using our current resources too badly. We should definitely reduce the use of fossil fuels and lower the rate we buy and use cars. Burning fossil fuel, driving cars that release carbon dioxide, this is the most direct harm to our climate. Getting full usage of the space we live in is a good suggestion. I feel like the real estate industry always hold the point that bigger houses are always the better. But actually we don't need that much space. Finish everything on your plate when eating is something we all can do. Last quarter when I was taking sociology class I was shocked by the fact during lecture that our school once produced 40 pounds of food waste within a week. That was really shocking. If that's how much food we are wasting in a school, I can't imagine what's the picture when enlarging the scope to the globe. We should take as much as we can actually consume. This is connected to the suggestion I personally feel most resonating--think clearly about the relationship between consumption and life. Are we buying too many things that they are already over the limit of being proper and environmental-friendly? People are buying because they always feel they need something newer and fashioner. The commercial industry is trying to convince their consumers that they need more. In fact, what we already had is enough. I remembered last quarter when I was watching a documentary, it talked about that the fashion industry is built on the expense of environment. The fancy clothes we are buying, the cosmetics we are using, the bags we are holding in our hands...They all kill the environment gradually in a way we don't notice. 
     <br><br>
As the earth is holding more people with decreasing resources, we as human beings should really think for the sustainable future and the life for our following generations. Making personal changes in life is not hard, but greatly helpful.

This video makes the film, “A Climate of Doubt,” make more sense. Given that there is a generational divide based on resistance to cultural change and where people are in their lives, I can imagine how people do not want to give up their dream house/car/lifestyle. However, it is important to think about the other people who are suffering the consequences of this abundant and harmful lifestyle in the United States that equates success with economic prowess displayed through extravagant living choices. If you really struggle with doing all of these five things, I think it’s easier to sacrifice two or three things to make some difference. For example, it’s really hard for me to opt for taking the bus to work (which would take an hour) versus drive my mustang (which is a twenty minute drive at most, and basically my first love), but I have definitely been cutting more and more meat out of my diet over the past two years and shop MUCH less. 
     <br><br>
Our society as a whole needs to restructure what we value as desirable and success markers. I have seen examples in the music industry, pop culture, television etc. show pride in having a huge house, multiple cars, huge closets, etc. and idealizing the “bigger is better” assumption that carry on this lifestyle hurting our environment.

<p>
After watching the lecture video "Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?" , it motivated me to do what I can for the climate and inspire change. Ken notes that his generation's refusal to change further inspires me to carry out actions that can benefit the environment. He references five lifestyle ways to reduce carbon footing to which I find them very practical. Simply, we have to use less of the energy we use to power our homes and cars. By this, we can contribute to climate change as well as saving our own money. Our generation could be more educated and aware of the climate disaster compared to the others, but we aren't making progress if we aren't using our knowledge to its full extent. Knowledge is power if utilized properly. But I believe in the future of our generation and we will spark a change for the world.




</p><hr>


<p>

I feel like Ken has so many great points in this lecture, but I also do have a contradiction to this. Cities are some of the most overpopulated regions and they contribute to climate change significantly. Urbanization contributes to overpopulation and gentrification. Americans will absolutely think they are entitled to whatever they want, but if the government actually did put restrictions on diet, housing, family size, transportation, then it would help the environment but people could claim that it is an intrusion on their freedom. I think that reducing meat consumption would be extremely intelligent but coming from a mainly carnivorous family, it is hard to convert entirely. As for fashion, choosing to shop at a thrift shop vs buying new clothes in a privilege. Now that up-cycling is in style, thrift shops have raised their prices. Sustainable fashion will be hard to transform the industry from fast fashion.



</p><hr>


<p>

In this video, it was refreshing to hear from Ken that there are multiple ways and choices that we can make to cut our carbon footprint in half. First off, it was very surprising to hear that doing smaller things like taking a bus to school or work or moving to a major city work hand in hand to create a better impact on our earth's climate. Something that was obvious but never occurred to me was realizing a relationship with clothing, food, and consumption (in everyday life) is key into taking large steps to fight a climate crisis. 
     <br><br>
I thought that it was an interesting choice to include the conversation of generational responses to the 5 different ways we can reduce our carbon emissions. When asking a younger generation what they think about reducing their footprint, we see a range of answers that equate to “That's not so bad.” Even mentioned in the video was the fact that students would get angry about today's consumer culture, finding time to go to thrift shops to lessen their impact. In comparison, the main response of people in older generations was usually negative. These individuals do not want to give up on their wealth, prestige, and privilege, which honestly made me disappointed, as they were the that handed off the planet to us. 
     <br><br>

Its always interesting to listen to the conversation of younger generations and older generations when faced with this topic. I always find it weirdly concerning that people of older generations choose to live the way they did, and now find relaxation in living the same way. By this logic, its only up to us to find a way to make this planet is the best it can be, which isn't fair.



</p><hr>


<p>

In my opinion, starting to do what the five tips mentioned above in Ken’s video could be either hard and easy. To say this lifestyle is hard, it means that you need to change completely from previous one; to say it’s easy, this is the closest solution we could step once determined. In my hometown, most people live in apartments since the scarce lands need to satisfy the demand of a large amount of population. There is car number limit. Each day of the weekdays, cars whose last of number is the pointed number are limited to enter the main area of the city. Therefore, the numbers of cars in the city will decline and traffic pressure and pollution will decrease by a certain amount. Several years ago, the one child policy still prevailed in my country. Not appreciating this policy, it was enacted in an unprecedented way but ended up with a huge decline in the rate of population increase. The reason that these policies and rules are so successful is the strong execution of government and high fines. These rules may not guarantee people’s freedom and equal rights of deciding the birth of babies, the parts that are always being criticized, but for a country like that, I cannot come up with any other better solutions. 
     <br><br>

On the contrary, for the US there could be tons of possibilities. We all not the power and effectiveness of peer pressure. I believe that, started with ourselves, more and more people could be influenced and start to act. Making trivial changes is the best way, and the strongest way for us to act right now.

Gen y and z are much more involved politically than generations before us, partially due to social media. Even in iv you can see that most restaurants have switched to compostable straws. Most students bike partially because of the small distances and the hassle of parking, but it is easy to see on a personal level, Gen y and z are pretty environmentally conscious, especially compared to previous generations.

I was excited when in this video you mentioned that you had five suggestions of how we can take immediate action to mitigate the climate crisis. To my relief, I am already doing all of these things, some of them by choice and some by circumstance. Since I never got my driver's license, I do not even have the option of driving my own car. This mean that I carpool, walk, or use public transportation wherever I go. Living in a place like Santa Barbara means that even the smallest of apartments are expensive, and a roommate is a necessity for anyone with little money to spare. My diet is largely plant-based, and the place I live makes this convenient for me, for which I am very grateful. There are a variety of meat substitutes in local grocery stores, and I plan to try them all. The thought of rearing more than two children is frankly an overwhelming one, and I don't plan on trying my luck. Finally, as any broke college student will tell you, I don't have money to waste buying sixty items of clothing a year, especially fresh-off-the-rack, never-been-used clothes. I am proud to say that thrift stores are my friend. 

     <br><br>

As for the difference in thinking between generations, I think it all has to do with what we were taught to want. Older generations were taught that the image of success was a big house, fancy cars, and four children. Success for us means a livable planet, and that means making some changes to our daily lives.



</p><hr>


<p>

Honestly to me, it is insane to know that there are solutions, but due to people being so involved in their materialistic ways it seems almost impossible to get everyone on board. Some would argue that it is hard work to get there, but from my point of view all five things would save money and you can still live a very happy life. It really makes me think about how altered our sense of reality must be in order to crave a Gucci belt than protect our environment.

While I do try and implement this advice into my own personal life already, I cannot help but speak about my own personal grievances with public transportation in its current state in the US. Previously, I have heard complaints from many friends and families about the inefficiency of American public transportation compared to other countries but never gave it much consideration. However, once I came to UCSB and heard about our free access to the MTD bus system, I was happy to not need a car because I am a menace on the road. While I do frequently make use of the bus system, the fact that there are days where there is only a single bus making the rounds and it takes intervals of 30 minutes to arrive is extremely frustrating. I can imagine how much worse it could get in more crowded places such as downtown LA, where it is possible that a bus might skip a stop because it is too full. While I do intend to continue using public transportation in the foreseeable future, having a car is more convenient because of how inefficient our bus systems are compared to any European country. I hope that the government can consider allocating more of its budget towards public transportation, if only to keep people like me off the road.

This lecture introduces the ways we can account for our carbon footprint, it all sounds so simple for younger generations, but another side of people, relatively the older generations seem to have a problem with the solutions Ken presents to us. And I see where some of these people are coming from, some people don’t want to give up their cars because they feel like public transportation is awful, some people feel entitled to splurge on themselves because they worked hard for their things. But at the end of the day, if we keep continuing on this path of hurting our planet,then we won’t have a future at all to sustain the human population. it’ll all be too late. Like Ken said, in order to begin mitigating, we first have to embrace that we can change. One of the things mentioned as a solution was having less children, either 1 child or none, this kind of bothered me in the sense of how it was phrased and said. I feel that couples should be educated more on ways to prevent unexpected pregnancies, and couples who want a child should understand the change it’ll have on human population. They should be educated on these effects.

After watching Kens lecture "Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?" the biggest take away I had was the perspective taken on the five major keys to improve carbon footprint by both younger and older generations. In the lecture I was surprised to hear that living in cities could help to cut down on carbon footprint as i always assumed that it would actually create a bigger carbon footprint. Growing up, I was always told by my parents and other elders, that my main goal in life was to get a good job that could help me get a nice big house and a nice car. I always understood this to be a success or "American Dream" view rather than a generational one. As I got older, I too have found myself contempt with the idea of living anywhere that was nice enough to be considered sustainable with a car thats only job was to get me from point A to point B. I assumed i had this mindset because of my financial situation, or because I haven't gotten that dream job yet. I have never attributed this mindset with the ideology that I simply just don't want the biggest house with the fanciest car - or find it necessary enough. Before watching this lecture, I thought I had a pretty fair enough grasp on food waste and its vitality, but I was truly shocked to learn that nearly 1/3 to 1/2 of food is wasted on average and that the production of one pound of beef equates to the production of 30 pounds of lentils. We as a society have done a lot of damage to our planet, but if we just shutup about insignificant matters and put an active end to the climate crisis, we could potentially be saving ourselves thousands of damage.

After watching both lecture videos, it's clear that making these changes in one's lifestyle can have a significant impact. Even though everyone has grown up with the idea of the "American Dream," it doesn't mean that we can't pursue that dream by lowering the size of our homes and consumption. Yes, having multiple cars and a big, beautiful home seems like the best life one can have, but there's no need for it. It doesn't help that our society promotes overconsumption of things to show a person's wealth and status. People like to brag about how much clothes they have or how big their house is, however, if we continue over consuming there won't be anything to brag about. I know sometimes an issue people have with lowering their consumption is due to the idea that they have to  give up things they enjoy. However, clearly that is not the case and people can still enjoy what they want. Lessening one's consumption just means that people should enjoy things in moderation and being realistic of what's needed. The other day in lecture someone mentioned, "People don't have to go vegan or vegetarian, just eating less meat per day can make a significant impact." I heavily agree with this statement because if everyone just decreased their meat consumption a bit each day it adds up to make an impact. Sometimes the issue of climate change can feel daunting and impossible to solve, but simple solutions that Ken mentions can make a large impact if everyone engages in them.

Past generations believe that owning large houses, eating meat based meals, and having a surplus of material goods is considered to be the good life. Unfortunately, the life that these past generations consider as being good is very problematic to the environment. It's important that we remember that most of the things we believe in came from someone else. When we realize that what is considered to be the good life is a societal creation, we become empowered. We are capable of shifting society's ideals! The new good life can be one that involves living in smaller houses, eating vegan, buying sustainable products, and embracing minimalism. The new good life will be one with the environment in mind. People are influenced by the things they see on tv and social media. If people and companies in positions of power started advertising caring for the environment, they could positively influence people onto a better path.

I agree that once we all realize the good that will come out of changing lifestyles that we will be empowered. However are we all willing to make the change? As you said, television and social media have a great influence on lifestyles. I myself find myself wanting a better home, better clothes and better car. Why? because of the lifestyles I see being displayed on TV and social media especially by celebrities showing off. Companies and people in power will not promote a friendly environment lifestyle as it would not benefit their pockets. Therefore it is less likely that they will do anything that will make them lose profit. It will take a lot of power to make something like that happen.

<p>
I definitely agree that this generation is more open to making lifestyle changes for the better of the Earth, yet I am not 100% sure all of us will actually implement these things in their lives. Hopefully, we will see what our generation will do once we graduate and are able to choose where to live and what transportation to take. Regarding the past generation, I feel like it is really hard for people to break out of a mentality they have grown into. I understand what their thought process is, but I obviously cannot agree with it. Hopefully, our generation can see how the last did not make a change, and can be more confident to save the Earth as it is our last chance. All of the given solutions are all big changes in our lifestyle but are positive and would actually benefit us, so hopefully most of our generation will be on board to eat better, shop smarter, and make better choices in transportation and housing.

Many people are filling "stuff" with luxury homes and utility vehicles. The American "" that previous generations hoped would continue to cause so much damage to the planet. I hope they spend a little time and think that in the long run, all these things will make them discover that these properties are left to their children and grandchildren. As the professor has said in other videos, knowledge has power only when it is used. Making small changes, such as following a plant-based diet and restricting purchases as consumers, most of our generation can do "Five Things to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint," which will have a huge impact on your carbon footprint Significant impact. Our generation wants to use what we know to make the planet more livable. Unfortunately, one person changing their lifestyle is not enough to have an effect on the situation. The crisis is not personal, everyone must act. Only the government can make more people act. But it is difficult for such a government to get a referendum.

Professor Ken Mentions that we can help stop the effects on climate change by buying less clothes, switching to a plant based diet, moving into a smaller home, having less children and changing our ways of transportation. As he said it seems very appealing and somewhat easy but it is more difficult than I actually think it is to change our style of living. I'm not saying that I can’t do all any of them all I’m saying is that I don't think I could do all of those things to help. I am actually already completing one of the tasks and that is keeping the clothes that I have for a longer time and if I my clothes don’t fit I donate it. 
     <br><br>
 When speaking to the people around me about their future and if they would like to have a big family many respond with “no”. Many people my age have told me that they would only like to have one or two kids which is a huge difference in perspective to people’s views 30 years ago. Honestly I wouldn’t want to have a huge family either I prefer to be blessed with 2 children. Even though many say they only want a maximum of 2 kids they would still like to have a big house. I think that people want a big house is because they want to provide to their kids what they didn’t have growing up and on the plus side a bigger home would help to invest money. 
     <br><br>
 Transportation is changing. Even though we aren’t moving to using bikes to get to places we are beginning a new era of electric cars. Having an electric car isn’t as helpful as switching to a bike but it is still a reduction on our carbon footprint. Once we start to use renewable energy more often, switching to electric cars will help more than they are helping now because we won’t be using fossil fuels to charge the cars instead we will be using clean energy. 
     <br><br>
 Switching to a plant based diet is the hardest thing that I will encounter. I come from a very meat oriented family which is the reason that I think switching to a plant based diet is difficult for me. I haven't tried to fully go on a plant based diet but I have tried some plant based foods and they don’t capture my attention. I don’t think that the taste is the best. I may be biased but I don't think that plant based meals are as good as meals that include meat. I will try to eat less meat to make a step forward to change my diet but I don’t think i can fully convert to a vegan diet.

This lecture was fascinating to me as I feel it truly explained why we, as individuals, do not do all we can to prevent the climate crisis from worsening. I have been a vegetarian for 6 years, partially because of environmental reasons, and people are almost always surprised when I tell them this. Almost every time, people say they could never do it or can’t imagine their own diet without meat. Whenever someone says this, I can’t relate, because transitioning to a vegetarian diet was pretty easy for me. To me, anyone can be vegetarian, and it is really not a difficult lifestyle change. However, I have to keep in mind that people can be extremely stubborn when it comes to their personal choices, and I keep these thoughts to myself most of the time. Watching this lecture, I realized that I am, unfortunately, guilty of the exact same thing. I love being able to drive my car and having the freedom to go wherever I want without needing to use public transportation or biking. Driving is something that I truly could not imagine my life without, despite the fact that I am fully aware of how detrimental the fossil fuel industry and vehicle emissions are to our environment. This lecture definitely reminded me that the climate crisis is far too important to be picky about what I chose to do in an environmentally friendly way. Recently, my goal has been to shop more at thrift stores or buy less in general due to the consequences of fast fashion. I believe that everyone should have some type of goal in mind to be more environmentally friendly, and try to force themselves out of their comfort zones a bit for the benefit of our environment. 
      <br><br>
Although I am in complete support of individuals taking action in their own lives to decrease one’s carbon footprint and thus improve the state of our environment, it is incredibly frustrating to me that I feel responsible for an issue that I had very little part in creating. Looking at the fossil fuel industry, animal agriculture, and many more destructive processes, it is clear that there must be a much larger change. Many people, especially older generations, do nothing to help in the climate crisis. I believe that the most common thought in relation to the climate crisis is that one person can not make a difference or their lifestyle choices are not capable of being altered because of their own beliefs. However, if enough people take action, changes will be made. If enough people take on a more plant based diet, for example, the animal agriculture business will see less of a demand for meat, and thus limit their production. I find it disheartening that the responsibility is placed on individuals because I think that the majority of people are not willing to take action. The responsibility should instead be placed on big corporations and industries who have little to no concern for our environment. However, I know it is not possible for the fossil fuel industry to suddenly turn around and take on strictly environmentally friendly processes. I just hope that we do not act as individuals too late, as we are nearing a time when climate change is too far gone and our planet will never be the same.

Affluence, consumerism, and a desire for endless luxuries are the traits that drive Americans towards unsustainable lifestyles. 
       <br><br>

A change in lifestyle habits must ultimately stem from a change in one’s mindset. For every generation, as exhibited in the video, the American Dream has been categorized by all things supersized whether it be owning the biggest house, most extensive wardrobe, or keeping up with the latest tech advancements. We’ve rarely thought about the implications these desires have on workers in developing nations who are vastly underpaid,  exploited by sweatshops, and forced into labor from a young age, let alone the unseen effects on our earth such as carbon dioxide emissions. 
       <br><br>

I agree with Professor Hiltner, my generation gives me hope as popular culture has recently begun supporting more sustainable practices such as using reusable water bottles (Hydroflasks), dressing in vintage clothing, and an array of vegan food options. However, it’s important not to ignore the unsustainable practices popularized by my generation such as “flex culture,” which involves excessive spending on luxury goods and the rise of online shopping which only increases packaging waste and greenhouse gas emissions through personal deliveries for everything from meals to clothes.

I very much appreciated what you said about how we have to look at our own practices and their impacts on the climate crisis. Because, as Hiltner pointed out, I think we've broken free of this "one life fits all" notion and allowed ourselves to consider a life that is not the large house with 2 cars and a picket white fence, and maybe one that is happier for it. As you pointed out, however, we are guilty of other dangerous cultural habits. These are definitively, subtler and completely different from the boomer generation, but in themselves dangerous to a stable climate. We have begun to isolate ourselves via technology, and ignore those near to us so we can converse with those a thousand miles away. This is dangerous for two reasons. First, it breaks down our sense of community and our ability to craft local solution with our physical neighbors. This is a worrisome trend in general, but of particular threat to the climate crisis, since nearly all of the solutions we ourselves can implement require strong community bonds, including gardening/purchasing local food , pushing for bike and pedestrian friendly areas/increasing mass transit, and just having the conversations we need to have. Secondly, it allows us to group ourselves around like minded individuals and receive our own polarized news sources, which just creates an echo chamber that does not actually shift the conversation. When we do interact with opposing viewpoints, arguments online typically devolve into insult contests. Also worth noting, the rise of social media has brought about a new level of superficiality which can only fuel our love of consumption.

This lecture reminded me of how many of us have changed our beliefs of things that are necessities and those which are wants. Ken's statement on us having fewer things can be seen in two ways. For example, the former can be seen as us sacrificing what we currently have while the other can shift our focus to what we have too much of. To elaborate, although many of us can take the perspective of us giving things up I believe we can just as easily shift our thinking into having too much because the reality is consumerism has taken in my opinion, a mental leash on our world. Putting worth on materials rather than the wellbeing of people, the species we share the earth with and, the planet itself has affected us as a species to develop our core values on what we have and not on what we manifest. Speaking on our carbon footprint that is I believe that in my experience I think that one of my most eco-friendly moments was when I was in high school. In high school, although I went to a school that was 13 miles away (LA miles), I found myself taking the train and bus to school relying mostly on public transportation to school along with being a vegetarian for the full four years I was in high school. In relation to the lecture, my personal experience helps me see firsthand the changes we can make and how they really aren't that bad when you make them a daily part of our lives.





</p><hr>


<p>
I agree with the majority of what was said in this lecture. However, I think that a few things must be said about each of the five ways that someone can reduce their carbon footprint.
       <br><br>


1) Transportation: As someone who doesn't own or have a need for a car at the moment, I think that biking and/or walking is a great alternative. Unfortunately, not everyone can afford to give up personal transportation. Those who live in areas dominated by grey infrastructure (major roads and freeways, little accessibility by foot) and poor public transportation have no other option than to use a car to travel to and from jobs and other obligations. Research towards cleaner-burning fuels would be more beneficial than encouraging a large number of Americans to essentially give up a crucial part of their daily lives. 
       <br><br>


2) Housing: Admittedly, the chance to own a spacious, well-furnished house in the suburbs sounds appealing, especially in this economy. On another hand, a smaller house with fewer environmental consequences also sounds nice but doesn't quite have the same appeal as the former. I feel as if this matches the overall sentiment of the American public and their idea of achieving the American Dream through ownership/possessions. In order for more people to switch over to smaller housing like suggested, the demand and construction for larger square-footed houses need to go down, while the production and costs of efficient housing need to go up, especially in prime locations.
       <br><br>


3) Diet and Food Waste: With up to 50% of our food going to waste, you'd think that we'd care more about the economic implications that this has on our wallets (once again, in this economy!). I think that we need to at least emphasize the benefits of composting more of our food waste, if not scaling food production overall. In terms of meat consumption, going plant-based isn't that hard nowadays, especially with the vast amount of choices and meat-alternatives that we have. Well, at least in the United States that. The biggest challenge would be to reduce consumption in other countries, where meat may be the most easily available source of protein they may have in their diet.
       <br><br>


4) Population: I agree with Ken on the idea that overpopulation is one of the, if not the biggest threat to the future of our planet. However, it is both naive and unrealistic to try and limit families to up to just two children each. From the lack of birth control, to individual morals, to increased rates of survival in developing nations, there are too many factors that would make the child limit nearly impossible to implement.
       <br><br>


 5) Possessions: I agree with everything said here. Nothing to counter.

I liked how you listed 5 things we can do to mitigate our impact on this planet. I am fortunate to live off campus and have the bus take me to where I need to go. I never brought my car down here. I just walk or take the bus. The other four elements that I need to use is doable. I really enjoyed taking these notes and sharing the videos with my family and they were very receptive of the information.




</p><hr>


<p>

After watching both films, I was most intrigued by the 5 ways we can reduce carbon footprints since it explains how we can take action. The changes that Ken displays aren’t too difficult and people could do them with minimal effort. I’ve personally been doing of ⅗ without knowing, and now I plan to do all five. 
       <br><br>

When I arrived at Santa Barbara I wasn’t happy to be riding the bus, since its a hassle, especially when you miss it by a few seconds. Well now I’ve gotten used to it and prefer to wait 20 minutes instead of paying for an uber, by doing this I am saving my money and preventing the rise of co2 levels. I would say it’s a win for my future in many aspects. For the second tip, regarding housing, my family and I currently live in an apartment, but in the future, I do plan on buying a small house, that I could call home. For the third one, I’ve personally never been a meat person, and I believe it has to do with the way my mom would cook. Back home we ate meat 2 times a week and it’ll just be my dad eating it, so we slowly stopped incorporating meat in our diet. There have been times where I just don’t eat meat for a week and it’s totally okay. It’s crazy to think that there are people out there eating meat every day without knowing the harm they’re creating to the environment and their health. Eating a plant-based diet has so many benefits, but people aren’t well informed. For the fourth method of prevention, decreasing our population, it is crazy to see how our population grew from 3 billion to 7.7 billion people in 61 years. I find it crazy that people had large families, I’ve personally only wanted 2 children, and that seemed like a lot, so I may just do 1. And finally, for the last tip, the majority of my clothes are hand downs from my sister and we also thrift shop since there are many bargains there.
       <br><br>

Personally, all of these tips are manageable and every human should be informed so they can take action. A way of promoting them could be making a social media account since our generation is always on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and etc. Sadly there will be people in denial, such as the older generations who don’t care and won’t contribute to making a change since they won’t be affected by the consequences of climate change.



</p><hr>


<p>

The thought that what can I do today that would save us in the future? It seems so huge that we can't really do anything. But learning that I can do a lot by simply not using a car, or living in a small house. Living in a city would drop our foot print by dramatic amounts and eating a plant based diet and not wasting anything would be effective. however the main issue is getting nearly 8 billion people on board with this life style simply isn't possible. Large houses and eating lavishly are way people can show their wealth and power. American homes in general are much bigger and we use a lot more electricity then other countries. I hope that in the future the norm would be small portion and smaller housing, however the best way people show off are through houses and cars. The wealthier people are the ones that will be causing the largest carbon footprints but in the end they are human too. Their peers will want to brag about the size of their home, the power of their cars and the feast they can provide. I can't blame them as their culture is what drives this fact. Rich people use a lot more resources and america is rich. We will always strive for bigger and better which is a huge problem as to why America creates such a massive carbon foot print on the world. With this culture, it will be difficult to lower our carbon output.

<p>

I am very glad to learn about those very practical ways to reduce my carbon footprint. This is actually one of the things I was looking for when I signed up for this class. I find the first three ways relatively reasonable and intuitive. However, I haven’t really thought of the last two ways. People have been talking about the exponential growth of our world population, but only a few of them draw connections between population growth and climate change. Moreover, the last way (to rethink our relationship to stuff) makes me think of the zero waste movement, where people strive to produce as little waste as possible. Their actions include simple ones like bring reusable bags to grocery stores to relatively complicated ones like making their own shampoos and make-ups. I understand that we do not have to live in a somehow extreme way to save our planet, but at least something is better than nothing.



</p><hr>


<p>

With the way American society currently sits, our living style truly revolves around the idea of materialism. Not to slander capitalism, but materialism is a main result of it. The way we are taught to succeed in this system is to work hard and take motivation from those above you so finally when you make it you are able to live the lavish lifestyles you once admired and dreamed of. Thus causing as more and more adults gain wealth an abundance of nicer materials being purchased and larger homes being built. However this view and perspective need to be changed as it is not environmentally sustainable. With bigger cars comes more co2, with bigger homes comes with more co2 used in the production of the home and more energy wasted on lighting and heating and other bills. 
       <br><br>
A minimalist lifestyle is needed for change to actually be made in slowing down the effects of climate change and to reduce our carbon footprints. As Ken mentioned there are 5 not so difficult steps to be made, some of which are fortunately becoming popular trends anyways. Things like moving into denser cities where smaller apartments are lived in and cars are not needed for transportation are ideal as they instantly cut out a huge chunk of per capita carbon footprint. Other lifestyle changes like thrift shopping are not only environmentally beneficial but "trendy" as well as many teens and young adults quest for vintage styled fashion. Other lifestyle changes like becoming vegan are also just all-around beneficial as a much smaller co2 footprint is produced while supporting humane treatment of animals and becoming a much healthier human being. With these small steps noted by Ken there is an easy way for the new generation to take on the challenges of climate change by greatly reducing our carbon footprint by making simple lifestyle changes that keep the world's health in mind.

This video really gave me more hopeful outlook on the future of our climate than other videos assigned in past weeks. To know that a few lifestyle changes can at the very least make an impact on lessening our carbon output and that these lifestyle changes are becoming more and more reasonable in the eyes of my generation is in a way comforting. Making these lifestyle changes the norm in our society while difficult is at least becoming more and more acceptable as the days go on. I find it extremely important that awareness of what an individual can do to personally decrease their carbon footprint because it seems much more realistic in the current political climate to enact cultural change than to pass legislation directly addressing carbon output.


</p><hr>


<p>
I found this video very helpful because Ken clearly laid out steps we can take to improve the planet. It also made me feel hopeful because with every lifestyle change comes a big decrease in one’s personal carbon footprint. The statistics Ken gives are eye opening, like when he says, “Owning and driving an automobile counts for about a quarter of our individual climate footprints.” This puts into perspective how important it is to limit car use as much as you can. In talking about food, Ken states, “Producing a pound of beef emits the same amount of greenhouse gasses as producing 30 pounds of lentils.” This statistic shocked me. Why is this not a more widely known fact? I believe that if this fact was more publicized, many people would alter their eating habits, at least slightly. 
       <br><br>

Relating to clothes and consuming, I am deeply disappointed with consumer culture. It is sad how people equate happiness with the amount of objects you own, such as clothes, cars, and much more. While I know people who buy brand new clothes every week, I also know people who shop only at thrift stores and consciously do not buy into fast fashion. I think it is very helpful, also, that shopping at thrift stores is now a very trendy thing to do. This gives me hope that my generation will act at least in the clothing sector. 
       <br><br>

Unfortunately, Ken’s generation recoils when faced with change. This relates to a previous video in further backing up the idea that my generation needs to become in charge. It is evident that his generation has shaped the modern world, however, our way of life can and should be changed. We need to embrace this change.


</p><hr>


<p>

I have been wondering for a while what I could do in order to help out and act against climate change. These suggestions are something that I would for sure keep in mind. In terms of the transportation I have always liked taking the train because it was the way I would get to places as I was growing up. As for going on a larger plant-based diet is something that I really want to transition to. I have been trying to become a vegetarian for a while now. Now that I am taking this class and knowing this is something, I can do really does give me hope that what I am doing is helping out.  Now knowing that if I do have a plant-based diet can really help out with my carbon footprint is just the push I needed. This will help me transition into becoming a vegetarian. Thrifting has been something that I actually really enjoy doing. I will continue to thrift clothing and transition into making that my primary way of getting stuff that I need. These are things that I can live with and is very doable. Consumerism is such a big problem and if cutting back on stuff mean a lot to climate change then it is something that everyone should be doing. Having all the latest clothes and cars is not important, what is important is the planet. Embracing change is what is needed.



</p><hr>


<p>

I appreciate the simplicity of this video and how easily the 5 things we can do to reduce our carbon footprint really are, at least for my generation who are just beginning their lives. These are all very easy concepts to understand, and to slowly integrate into our lives. For myself, the hardest thing to fix would be transportation. I rely heavily on my car for getting to school and working right now. But that isn’t to say I can’t change that in the future. I do hope to live in a big city, so I would need to get comfortable walking places, riding a bike, or using public transportation. I do think that if we had a more efficient and clean system of public transportation such as electric buses or subways/trains, using them would be much more appealing. As for some other concepts such as consumerism, I think most students understand and know they cannot spend frivolously, and that material things just don’t matter that much. Living on a budget really does teach you that, and I am grateful to have been taught this so early on in life, because as we heard from Ken’s comment about his generation, most cannot envision life without their large houses, cars, and other material things that they worked their lives for. I understand how they feel deserving of those things, but when the well-being of every person on the planet is at stake, including themselves and their families, does that stuff really matter? People haven’t been put in those positions where they have to question those things, but if people don’t change their mindsets about lavish lifestyles and consumerism, we will be in even more trouble than we already are.



</p><hr>


<p>

While I understand Ken’s sentiment, I have to disagree with the generalizations that my generation is ok with the changes he brought up. Having grown up with my generation, I have a bit more pessimistic view on the whole topic. Our generation is regarded as progressive and the faces of change, yet so many of us are still stuck in the past. To the people in this class, these changes may not seem too bad, but that’s because we are an environmentally conscious group that isn’t truly reflective of my generation. I know many of my friends would find it very difficult to sacrifice the things that Ken mentioned in his lecture. This is because of the mindset and idea of success that was implemented into their minds from the older generation. In order for there to be a change, there really needs to be a more aggressive campaign to change the mindsets of both the older generation and newer generation alike. Although we are more open-minded to change, there are many in my generation that still do not care, or fail to act about the climate crisis.

I really enjoyed this lecture and I appreciate Ken’s knowledge and his desire to promote awareness. Out of the five ideas mentioned in order to reduce your carbon footprint, number five stood out to me the most since it is probably the one I was least aware of. When he said that the two most common reactions in students to his suggestions were positive ones I wasn’t surprised. And again, when I heard how people of his generation respond to his suggestion I wasn’t surprised. When he spoke about how his generation wants to “enjoy the fruits of their labor” it actually made me feel kind of bad because that is what I’ve always wanted too I guess. Yes you go to college to become educated, but also to secure a good job. A nice house and the ability to live comfortably and provide for my future family has always been the goal, so now I do feel a bit selfish wanting these “nice” things. I think people (myself included) need to not associate expensive things with success, but rather do what is right for our planet and try to become more minimalist.

I agree greatly with you, there comes a bit of sadness and defeatedness when thinking about what the older generation had and the sacrifices that the new generation has to make in order to make sure that the planet is still habitable decades later. Realistically, these things take a toll on the individuals and we not only have to change for the better of the people but also our individual ideas and mentality in order to actively and wholeheartedly help create a path for a better future.

Not only did this lecture video make me happy, but it also left me inspired. This was the video I was anxiously waiting for and happily listened to; Ken truly did his students well in this one. Although he only gave us a handful of ways to improve our carbon footprint by cutting it, at minimum, in half, they were very drastic changes for the better. I thought that the methods such as transportation, plant-based diets, family size, materialistic lifestyle changes, and population to consumption were easy things that everyone could adopt; if not all, at least making one change would drastically help. I think it is also important to note the fact that Ken made about the responses he’s heard. It makes sense that the younger people who support these changes are students in his classes, as they are very engaged with these ideas. However, it made me a little worrisome, but anxious in regards to the older population’s responses. Although they might say they were raised by their parents to “Live the American dream” and “Do whatever we want” our generation is far more progressive in comparison to them. Because of this progressive characteristic, I believe that our generation will have no trouble in fixing the problems and teaching those lifestyle changes to the generations that will come after us.

The old generation hold "American dream" and make the environment become worse. The minds are widely spread to people's heads and difficult to be changed. Therefore, a large societal change is necessary, which needs a lot of time and knowledge. Although it may be hard from the beginning and could only get little process, we still need to do it. We can just begin from tiny things around us like choosing biking or walking instead of driving. We still need to use our knowledge to persuade the old generation to join us. The more people join us, the faster we can success.

About the five ways to try to revert the climate crisis, I strongly agree with transportation and waste less food. In my country, there are so many cars everyday that the government has published a law regarding car regulations, which turns out that air quality indeed becomes better. And with development of public transportation, less people are driving on their own when they go out. I remember we discussed how much methane can one cattle release. So not just wasting less food can help to revert, but also we can change our diet, like we can eat chicken more instead of beef. These things should not be hard for us to do.

Much of what Ken acknowledges as responses of his generation stem largely from the ideas behind that of the American Dream. While varying from person to person, generally the ideas that the bigger the better and just having more speaks to status, fuel our carbon footprint heavily. Rooted largely in our identity as Americans, the concept of change largely strikes those of older generations as it's much of what they've ever known, as well as those before them. Inheriting a problem such as that of climate change, and all its adverse effects has held a large impact on younger generations who are realizing if we're compliant, then we're just as bad. With the tips given by Ken on how to actively effect change and reduce our own footprints, a lot of it stems from mindset and overcoming the ideas that fueled our society. Mentioning that people move to cities, and take public transportation, raises the question about how this would effect public infrastructure. Would this lead to more housing, or (well oversimplified) more congestion within cities? While riding public transportation is a great choice, would it become practical for cities across the country? As in would the government be able to support and move away from a society dominated so heavily by cars?

Thank you Ken for approving our generation and making us to believe we are well educated to use our energy and knowledge as much as possible to make up the mistakes made by the old generations. To me, my parents and my grandparents were living in the decades of fast growing industries. Every nation was like racing with each other to see who's faster in growing its industries or more specifically, the economy. They never thought about how many damages they had brought to our beautiful planet. They left us with uninhabitable earth. I am not blaming these old generations since most of them haven't got a chance to college. They just followed the government's instructions. Again and Again, it builds a vicious circle. They never thought about there would be one day which has no place to live. They never believe that natural resource could have its limit. When the limit is reached, all the bad results will come. Through watching Ken's videos, I keep asking myself what can we do to help save our planet, at least keeping it livable and sustainable when our future generations come. In fact, everyone can make a difference from changing a little habit of life like biking instead of driving, replacing plastic bags with repeatable used bags while shopping, reducing the time  of using air conditioning, etc.. When everyone starts to put in a little action from now, I believe we could make a profound impact and leave a healthier planet for our descendants.

After watching "Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?", I felt quite optimistic about the future. Learning about Ken's top 5 things American's can do to reduce their climate footprint encouraged me to be more open about applying those concepts into my own life. It made me rethink what I truly value in life; At the end of the day all that matters is my health and those around me. Longing for a huge house on the hill, having multiple cars in my driveway, owning countless luxury items and more do not matter to me as much anymore. I feel like I have a new perspective on life. I understand that it is going to be a constant battle of not purchasing things I want, but rather purchasing things I need, but I am motivated to win that battle. Not to mention, it will help me become more financially responsible. I would be saving money each year by reducing my mindless consumption and I could use that for items I actually need and will last me a lifetime. Once I begin utilizing all my things and letting go of the things I do not, true happiness will start inviting itself in. Once my items all serve a purpose, I will feel a sense of relieve and peace. Furthermore, I found Ken's fourth tip, "Have no more than one child per person" in a relationship to make a lot of sense. I come from a big family where women who only have 1-2 children is rare. My whole life I saw the women in my family having 3-6 children and I figured that would also be me, but now that I am aware we have to reduce the global population, I only want to have two children. I am inclined to send this video to my friends and family as I believe it will inspire them to rethink their values in life and consume with purpose.

The five things Ken outlined in this lecture video made me wonder how many of us actually follow it in contribution to fighting the climate crisis. I think my biggest skepticism is that Americans would cease to feed into the consumerism culture. What follows this is most likely the possibility that everyone will cut out meat from their diets. Or, that people would begin using more eco-friendly transportation other than their individual cars. I think many have joined in on this movement, but the numbers needed to make a big enough difference may be harder to attain than we hope. I think this is the sad truth of things, and like Ken said many feel they earned the right to this lifestyle and are adamant about continuing to live comfortably in that way.

       <br><br>

Because of this, I do believe that addressing the climate crisis would primarily consist of solutions brewed up through science. These five things are a good idea for our planet, without a doubt, but I may be pessimistic in believing that there are not enough who will adopt these ways, and put their desires and lifestyle choices before the planet’s health.

It is really worrisome that the older generation has such a negative response in Ken's 5 step cutback. I found the five steps like Ken predicted, interesting and not as tough as I expected. I guess as students we don't yet know what it is like to look for a house, buy a car, or have kids. Nevertheless, this mentality will kill our planet. If everyone took up at least some of these steps we could make a difference. Ideally all steps if executed will cut CO2 emissions in 1/2 or more as Ken said. These are things that we can all start to do today, we do not have to wait to cast our ballot or wait for another fire to roll in and put families at risk. Waiting around is only going to lead the end of earth.  It is scary that now we are in a time crunch, but not everyone knows or believes in it. This is not just a matter of time, but a matter of persuasion. As students from this class, we can all help to propagate the information and persuade others to take action, but we as students must do our part as well. I know it is hard to get over the lazy hump that comes with taking on a lifestyle change, but we owe it to ourselves, each other, and the future generation. Starting small with choosing to take the bus or biking over driving or taking an uber. Cutting out beef products as they contribute methane, a greenhouse gas that is 84 times more potent than CO2. These are things I have personally done. But, I am pushing myself to do more. I want to make the switch to a fully plant based diet, but I am easing my way into it now. Also, in the future when I do buy a house I will look fo one in the city so that I do not need to use a car. Cars are one of the chief contributors, especially here in SB. I, for one, am glad that there are other forms of transportation because personally I think cars are glorified death traps.

I found it really interesting to hear your summary of different generations’ responses to climate change solutions. It really shouldn’t be so hard to adjust our lifestyles in order to reduce our carbon footprints. Your generation, the people who started the trend of living large, lavish lifestyles, are not as open to adapting as the younger generations. Changes in the global climate require us to be willing to make the necessary compromises and changes in our daily lives.

I do feel by following Kent's 5 steps, we can have a a positive impact on our planet but it can very difficult for most including myself. Most people along with myself have switched the way they got around once they came here is Goleta. Most students switch to using bikes or the bus for transportation which is a great first step in leaving behind a smaller carbon footprint. Switching to a purely plant based diet is a difficult lifestyle to transition into but by including plant based options into certain aspects of your life, such as switching your dairy milk to almond milk. 
       <br><br>

The part including where the older generation doesn't want to conform to having a smaller house or not driving their polluting cars really disturbs me. They have no drive to help the planet. This is due to the fact their eduction on the planet was tainted when they were in school. They were told there was no pollution and they won't leave a carbon footprint. They have no drive to change their lifestyle in ways to help the environment.

This lecture has really useful information that all of us can use when speaking to others about reducing our environmental impact. The 5 actions listed by Ken that can be done today are important lifestyle decisions to keep in mind. I think these are especially important to share with college students as they are just starting to get that independence of living on their own. Personally, I found this extremely empowering; I switched to a vegetarian diet and currently make active decisions as a consumer to reduce waste as much as possible. Moving away from home is a big reason why I was able to do this and now whenever I go back I am constantly pushing my family to do the same. While a seemingly small victory, the widespread acceptance of more eco-friendly solutions can be witnessed with the amount of reusable water bottles. I am confident more impactful solutions and lifestyle changes (i.e. diet and transportation) are gaining the same amount of traction.
       <br><br>

I gain this confidence from personal experience and for that reason I think its worth acknowledging the "bubble" that is California. A close friend was born and raised in the midwest and it is interesting to see that there are a good number of his friends that post about their recent purchases of massive homes - usually just for them and their partner. Another recent trend I have seen on social media are posts that compare what $xxx,xxx buys you in CA vs. other parts of the US where housing is a lot cheaper. These posts effectively glorify huge mansions and support the idea that success is measured by the size of you home and how many (empty) rooms you have. While I don't mean to shame these posts or friends in the midwest, it signifies to me that getting people to accept smaller housing quarters as ideal will be something that takes a lot of work.

The "American Dream" makes the old generation keep destroying our environment. Everyone wants to have houses and luxury cars which make cause more release of carbon dioxide. I'm glad to see people in my generation prefer riding bikes or taking bus to driving. This is a good beginning of saving our planet. It's more important to work hard together which needs us to persuade and change the mind of the old generation, let them realize that they have responsibility to offer their children a better place for living.

American capitalistic ideals has encouraged generations to focus on materialistic value and has significantly affected the environment. I don't think that it is the fault of the people who simply believed that being able to afford a car and a house was important because that is all they knew. Now we can understand the ways in which our environment is harmed by our actions and how important it is to fix this. When watching this video I thought that in reality the people who have had the biggest Impact are those who are more financially stable or even rich. It is saddening to see that those mostly affected by these issues are poor communities who are not making a negative impact on the environment the way others are. If our values weren't so skewed people would be more comfortable leaving their lavish lifestyles in order to care about the greater good for everyone. Unfortunately it is hard to change the vision in past generations but fortunately we have time to change our own and still create an impact.

Upon watching this video, I asked myself, "what can I do to reduce my carbon footprint?". After reflecting for a bit, I realize that there are measures that I have taken in order to do so. Some examples of this can be seen in the way that I bike to school instead of taking a car which reduces the gas emissions. In addition, I frequently visit thrift stores instead of actual retail stores as well as bring reusable bags with me when I go grocery shopping. Lastly, I believe that by living in IV I am helping because of the way in which there are multiple people that live in the house and share rooms, compared to taking up one entire room for myself. However, after watching this video, I realize that there are a variety of more measures I can take in order to reduce my footprint. It is amazing how small changes in your lifestyle will help overall and I strongly believe that if everyone all worked together to make these small changes in their own lives, we would be able to make an impact to the environment for the better. I don't think that people see how their own actions could make a difference in the grand scheme of things and with such a huge population. Therefore, their mindset is that they could do whatever they want: drive themselves to work instead of choosing to carpool with someone. However, these small changes will be the catalysts for bigger changes in the future.

I will admit that I am guilty that I was stubborn at the thought of making changes to my diet by switching meat out for a plant based diet. I'm Mexican and so growing up in a household where food revolves around meat and then deciding to switch it out sounds very challenging. It's doable, not impossible. Culture definitely has a lot of power over its values and I feel as though Americans have this image that the American Dream is having your backyard BBQ in your large house with your partner and kids. Values and ideals have shifted for my generation and I'm very hopeful that we, as the future, will be more willing to change our habits for ourselves and for futures to come. While I haven't entirely switched meat out, I have reduced the number of days that I have consumed meat and swapped them out for alternatives. It's unfortunate that our society has created this notion that bigger is always better and should be strived for. But after hearing other's opinions, ideal, values, and concerns, I am very hopeful for change.

After watching the video “can one generation do what previous generations failed to do”, I found out that the ways to help the environmental problems are really basic and easy for people to do. Taking public transportation and living in the remote area. First, there are tons of benefits to take public transportation.  Taking public transportation could not only help the climate problem, but also could save enough money. It is really convenient to take public transportation and could help to solve the traffic jam problem. With less carbon dioxide, the air would become clean and it would help to release the global warming problem. So, I think it is easy to do that. Professor also states that people should have less children because the earth’s carrying capability is limited. I think we should concerned about this serious problem.

After seeing the lecture I feel more empowered to do something about the situation. After taking in all the information and learning about the effects the climate crisis will have on the whole world I do not just believe it is something that I should do but that I must. Hearing how many people in the boomer generation actually knew that climate change was a problem and only few people tried to do some changes to help out make me think that my generation can not let this continue. Like it or not this weight has been placed on our shoulders and instead of crying about it we should do something to change it. It is our duty to do as much as we can now because we will live the consequences and they will get worse up to the point where our children and grandchildren will not be live a full healthy life. Even though we may not like these changes at first and and will be tempted to go back to the ways our ancestors have taught us, we must be strong willed and not give up on the change we want to make in order to see a brighter future for those who come after us.

I found this video rather refreshing and hopeful compared to the previous few weeks’ lectures. The steps to reduce one’s carbon footprint by at least half seems so simple, and I will likely achieve at least a few of them. However, if only a small subset of people makes these changes, I fear that we will not make enough change in a short amount of time. 
       <br><br>
I experienced my first time living in a city last year. I lived in Bellevue, WA for an internship during the summer. I was given the option of either taking a rental car or receiving a stipend for other transportation methods. I did not take the rental car and instead used public transportation. I could live like that, given that public transportation is convenient and reliable. Bellevue and Seattle’s buses and light rail were on-time most of the time which allowed easy timing and planning. However, if I were to live in a place like Santa Barbara, where the buses come upwards of half an hour late, and rarely on time, I believe I would cave and drive a car instead.
       <br><br>
Eating a plant diet is something I do not believe I could start outright. But I believe I can make steps toward such a diet, such as eating meat only on the weekends or some days of the week. One of my teammates on the club tennis team eats meat on the weekends, which I thought was weird at first. Now I realize it really does make a difference. If the meat industry contributes so much to climate change, eating meat less than 1/3 of the week must make a non-significant difference on one’s carbon footprint.

It is crazy to think how long it took us to get to this point in development, and how fast it has degraded the environment. What society has told us for a long time is that it is good to have nice, big houses, the newest gas guzzling cars, and the newest clothes and devices - unused. Only dating back to the time of levittowns, people wanted to have their own suburban homes and lives, and now we can see how that is detrimental to the environment. Today, the situation and views have changed immensely; it’s now cool to have thrifted vintage clothes, to own electric cars, to be vegan and vegetarian, and to live in trendy small apartments.  However, there is still such a large demand for big mansions and new designer clothes, and to live the lifestyle many celebrities flaunt (which is usually not friendly to the environment). It is very clear where people’s values lie, especially in first world countries (especially America). 
       <br><br>


It took us so long to develop to this place and it took time to gradually develop this society, and along with it, our opinions on having more stuff. It is sad to me that it will take so long to reverse the damage that has been done in such a short amount of time. “Undeveloping” our views will take such a long amount of time, and therefore it will take a long amount of time before we can see changes in reducing environmental impact. This is especially because there are so many people who are reluctant to take it upon themselves to help reduce impact by making lifestyle changes.

       <br><br>

We have gotten to a point where the climate is being impacted immensely, and the majority of people will still not change, meaning that we must see the climate degrade for a longer amount of time before we start seeing the majority of the population making changes that will then slow the dying of the Earth.

As I watched this lecture video, my natural reaction was to feel that expecting everyone to switch their lifestyles this drastically is very unrealistic. Given the highly materialistic society we live in today, it sounded almost impossible to expect everyone to change their lifestyles in the ways that were described, especially when it comes to things such as housing or other luxurious items. I honestly began thinking to myself, “yeah, I could try to make these lifestyle changes, as difficult as it may be.. But what’s the point? What difference would it make if I, one of the billions of people on this planet, decided to drastically change the way I’m currently living for the sake of our planet?” However, as I dwelled more on these thoughts, I realized that this type of thinking is the exact problem. People don’t see how they could positively impact the future of our planet because it feels overwhelmingly insignificant to make these changes if not many others are doing so as well. This is why I feel most of these people won’t switch their lifestyles around until it becomes absolutely necessary. It doesn’t help that there are so many people on the media encouraging them to ignore the climate crisis, and continue living the way they are as they pose no actual threat to the future of our planet. I think once people begin to realize how serious of an issue this really is, then they’ll decide to take action. What they should realize now, is that if all of us humans as a whole group could cause so much damage to the planet, then we must also hold the power to clean up the mess we made if we all work together.

I agree that it is hard for individuals to feel as if they are making a difference.  After all, the direct effects of the actions of a single person are pretty much insignificant on a global scale.  As a species we have to work together to change things.  Your last sentence really made me think.  Humanity definitely has the power to slow down climate change, but we are not coming together and utilizing it.

This lecture video was eye-opening into what individuals can do to reduce their carbon footprint. Although changes in transportation and diet are more commonly advertised steps to take, I found Ken's discussion of food waste and population unique. I think that it is common for environmentally progressive thinkers to focus on limiting their waste production of plastics and disposables, but not food waste. Additionally, I have noticed that when many people think about population control, we focus on developing countries where birth rates are high. However, Ken's perspective forces us to think about our own impact of the choices we make for ourselves and our family. 
              <br><br>

        However, I think that it is very important to focus on the larger issue of the massive amount that corporations emit and pollute. We need to regulate these businesses through cap and trade programs and incentivizing the use of recycled materials if we hope to make change on a large scale. Although I believe that small changes that the individual makes can help over time, the time scale we are dealing with seems to be only shrinking everyday. We cannot except younger, progressive generations to change the trajectory of the climate crisis by taking these 5 steps on their own. We need large structural change, and that includes regulating big business..

I truly resonated with this piece "The American Dream" because I myself identify with the problem of what this article was trying to convey to its audience. We have become a society obsessed with materialism that comes cheap and at the fastest pace available, never wanting to settle for a lifestyle outside of this one which grants us so much ease of living. I say "we" as referring to Americans and others belonging to countries of large global power who reap these benefits off of less privileged countries who are expected to churn out the goods to fund this lifestyle for others. I myself have found myself guilty of this and i do realize that much of the things I am accustomed to are extremely harmful for the environment that would be very hard for me to part with. Fast fashion, driving around in cars, buying from large conglomerate companies and obtaining many petty material things are all things that I am used to as a way of life because it is convenient, and imagining a world where I cannot have access to these things is a very large shock for anyone like me to experience. I think this is the reason  so many people deny the existence of climate change and global warming despite the growing evidence and facts. When your very way of life that you have been accustomed to is suddenly challenged and called into question as a matter of ethics or morality, it is seen as an attack that needs defending. However, people also need to realize that without a habitable planet to live on there will be many more consequences for us and future generations to deal with than not being able to order clothes at the click of a button, consequences that threaten their lives as a whole and the fate of existence on this planet as we know it.

I feel like our generation, the younger one can most definitely come together to approach those 5 changes. I know so many young people who already do half of those things. The only two I can see being difficult to do is living in a smaller house and transportation. I feel as if having a car nowadays is very important to everyone and to simply get places and be independent. The struggle of not having a car in today's time is real, from getting groceries to having emergencies. I feel like having a car has become an essential part of life now, but with the invention of Uber and Lyft, I can see how it is not impossible to not own a car.  Living in Isla Vista has made me see how efficient bikes are and how it wouldn't be such a horrible idea if we all took up biking to get places. It only becomes a hassle with really long distances and when you want to carry things back. 

       <br><br>

People always aspire to live in big, beautiful homes. Even people who are environmentally aware live in big homes. I think that is a luxury many cannot reframe from, especially those who grew up living in smaller ones. I find this one the hardest for me to try and follow. But I definitely see how beneficial it would be so I will try to reset my mind into accepting the comfort of smaller homes.

I'm glad Ken begins with the question "What can I do to help?" That really is what we all ask ourselves at some point. His five suggestions on how to help the issue of climate change. Transportation is a tough one for me given that I work 20 minutes away and go back home to Anaheim every so and so. Housing is also a tough one because I have yet to enter the world after college and finding a home. Living in a big city does not sound hard at all, but as of now, transportation and housing are not as viable. If I end up working nearby and find a tiny little apartment, it wouldn't be too bad. Wasting less food is something I practice religiously and I'm not on the plant-based life, but being vegetarian or even cutting back on meat shouldn't be that difficult and I have already practiced reducing my meat consumption. 0-2 children sounds good even though I come from a culture that reproduces like heck. As for materialism, not a priority. After evaluation these 5 things, I look to the older generation and wonder, "Why would they, of all people, ever revert to a tiny apartment?" or "why would these boomers start riding bikes all of a sudden?" It all makes sense though because the newer generation grew into the reform and is made up of more groups of people. More cultures means more variance and less inclination to tradition. The progressive nature of the new generation is in part thanks to trends like metal straws and the "ok boomer" saying that all arose from this generational division. That's one of the pros of social media and the internet, it gets the message out, and fast. 
       <br><br>

At the end of the day, skeptics, who tend to be older, are going to say that alarmists use models to control the data while alarmists, usually younger, say that skeptics can't understand science. I feel the old generation won't be around by the time we're actually screwed.

I have often found myself asking this very same question all quarter. It pains me that the solution is so simply complex. The solution itself is so easy that Ken can boil it down into 5 easy steps, and yet, it is not. If you were to ask 40 high schoolers why they disliked working in groups for projects, odds are they would say that they often had to bear the weight of the project themselves, and usually at least one member of the group would do little to nothing to contribute for a wide variety of reasons. This is more or less consistent when you change the situation to an ideologically diverse and large population of people, but now, because the number of people increased, the number of people who do nothing to contribute also increased a lot. Now imagine 7 billion people that are supposed to work together on the project of saving the planet. All those people have to do is follow the steps that Ken laid out. Even though I follow them, and my friends and colleagues may as well, the prospect of having to count on more than 7 billion other people that I have never met to save the entire planet is terrifying. Nonetheless, as scary as it may seem, I am more than willing to take that gamble. I am willing to do my part to combat the death of the planet. While I may not have as much confidence as I would like to have in the prospects of humanity fixing climate crisis, you had better believe that I will bet my life on it. What choice do I have?

After watching “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?”, I’ve realized that obtaining information from reputable sources is crucial. Many scientists have predicted false things and have misconstrued different ideas regarding climate change and its effects on the population. Hiltner did a great job at explaining and promoting the 5 solutions to cut our carbon and climate footprint in half. Also essential, the knowledge of our ecosystems is another element that is necessary for people to understand because it enables them to respond to the effects of global warming, encourages them to change attitudes and behaviors, and helps them adjust to climate change trends. However, this isn’t a problem that can be solved by one entity. More education over climate change should be implemented in schools and be popularized in the media and in society. This is another step that is crucial to the fight against climate change and climate footprint. 
       <br><br>


Like Ken explained, there are five things we can do to cut the climate footprint we’ve made in half. Transportation, housing, diet, markets, and home life are all areas of life that we must change in order to eliminate our footprint. Though these alterations will surely change lifestyles, they will lead to a future of society that is salvageable and viable.

I will be 100% honest, I can totally understand why older generations do not want to give up some of the things Ken is suggesting. I get it, because I don’t necessarily want to give these things up in my future either. I want a big house in the suburbs, a nice car to drive my 3 kids around in, and plenty of clothes in my closet. However, as much as I want these things, I know I don’t need them. A sustainable future obviously doesn’t sound like the most luxurious future, but it’s the only future I can comfortably live; I could not imagine intentionally doing anything more damage to the planet than older generations already have. This is why I find it incredibly selfish that these same older generations who are forcing the rest of us to reduce our carbon footprint refuse to reduce their own. At this point, they no longer get the excuse of saying they’re unaware of the situation our planet is in. Climate change has been a largely politicized issue, and it’s well known that the older generations are more active at the voting booth than my generation. They’re aware of the damage they’ve caused and the damage they continue to do. As frustrating as it is, we have to come to terms with the fact that our generation is largely on our own with this problem.

I found both of this week’s video lectures from Ken to be quite interesting as he not only goes into the effects we as humans have had on the natural environment, but he also begins to introduce some of the ways we can work to mitigate the effects. I personally have taken up some of the suggestions that Ken made throughout this video including reducing food waste by composting at home and eating a predominantly plant based diet. I have attempted to influence some of my family members to make these kinds of lifestyle changes but have experienced some of the hesitation that Ken describes mainly occurs among his generation. I find it disheartening at times when my own parents are unwilling to make small changes to the way they operate on a daily basis in order to better the world they currently inhabit, their children inhabit, and generations of kin will (hopefully) inhabit. I look forward to returning home following my participation in this course, hopefully with more information I can present to my family in hopes of influencing small lifestyle changes.

I believe something can be done since we’re a generation that’s more upon acting for why we believe in. We march,  riot, call on those who are in the wrong publicly. Yes the boomer generation definitely messed the earth up for us but it’s not entirely their fault they had nothing going on at the time to make them even think that climate change was indeed very real. They were only warned on television and articles but never experienced anything. 
       <br><br>
In the film “Climate of a doubt” when the gas crisis hit many probably thought it was the pro-climate change people who made the gas go up since they wanted to tax on carbon therefor went for a pro-fossil fuels in order to have their gas at a lower cost which makes sense since the only thing they were worrying about was the gas prices and the war. People are selfish and wants what’s best in their interest not the planet but change can be done with my generation especially since everything is becoming electric and or solar/wind powered.

<p>

This class and video in particular has changed the way I view climate change. Before, it seemed like such a far away, impersonal issue that wouldn’t impact my life. But after all of the films, lectures, and readings, I can see just how much influence it has on every single person and organism on this earth. I now understand that I have a responsibility to this planet and I can take steps towards treating the earth more kindly.

       <br><br>

As a vegetarian, I felt pretty good about myself. Whenever Ken would mention that converting to a more plant-based diet, I would feel a sense of pride because I already do that. But as I’ve read and listened to in lecture, I’ve seen that that’s not enough. I shouldn’t be complacent and pat myself on the back for the one thing I did to help the environment because in all honesty, my decision to be vegetarian didn’t involve any consideration of the impact it would have on the planet – it was simply a benefit. Sure, I thrift or buy second-hand a good portion of my clothes. I bike to class now thanks to UCSB being a biking school. But not many of my decisions that just so happen to benefit the environment are intentional. I want to do better, but it’s hard to know how.

       <br><br>

Election season is upon us, which means I can be more conscious of the propositions being voted on and the candidates’ stances on climate change – not just presidential candidates, but local ones who have the power to implement policies in my city.

       <br><br>

I think one of the most significant things in this video was the fact that Americans care about having so much stuff. We truly don’t need all of the things we have in our junk drawers, we don’t need the articles of clothing that sit in the back of our closets. One thing I can definitely practice is buying less and keeping what I do own for longer.



</p><hr>


<p>
First of all, I wanted to say that this is, by far, my favorite video (so far) in the series. I think Ken did a great job of concisely stating the 5 most important lifestyle changes that we as a society should take into consideration. And these 5 changes aren’t even that difficult to make! Think about it: almost everyone who goes through college has to live in a dorm, and this is a great example of both communal living and a micro-apartment-style living space. Many students in this school do not own a car because everything we need is either in Isla Vista or in downtown santa barbara (which can be reached, free of charge to all students, on a bus). Technically, we begin to live more environmentally friendly the moment we choose to live on campus. 
       <br><br>

I also really resonated with Ken’s statement that older generations don’t like change. For example, how many older people don't want to listen to “young people music”, don’t want to “eat healthy like these young people”, and enjoy item hoarding (rather than trying to live a more minimalist lifestyle). This is a fact of life. The older you get, the less likely that you are going to be willing and able to make a change in your lifestyle. This mindset that is averse to change is very natural in older generations so one can’t exactly blame them for not living a greener lifestyle-  they’ve been told all of their lives that they can have/own pretty much whatever they want as long as they work hard. The American dream is killing our environment and although it is based on the ideology that anyone can become anyone as long as they put in the work, which is a healthy belief to have, it also allows for rampant capitalism, which isn’t healthy for our environment.




</p><hr>


<p>

It all comes down to capitalism. If we can co-exist with technological advancement and the sustainable living of all creatures, if we can rise up all together with no inequality, if we can be one human race rather than criticizing our differences, then maybe we can actually sustain on this earth. But no because assets are so important, money is so important, power is so important, we will never go there. There is literally almost just one radical way to change everything but no one in power is doing it. Do we really need to be in power? Where and how do we get power? Why do we need to follow the structure to do so? Can we not have structure? Would that be chaos? Are we in chaos now? Are we just complacent with our own chaos because we've been in it for a long time?

As someone who didn't grow up in America but have stayed in this country for more than 6 years, I find the American lifestyle much more lavish and wasteful than that of other countries. I am a huge fan of public transportation, and I would opt for mass transit whenever I can; however, the U.S. simply wasn't built upon that ideology, and in many cases not having a car would make the commute much more difficult. This has nothing to do with having a large country; China, for instance, has a very developed high-speed rail network that has completely revolutionized the way people travel across the country. I am also a proponent of wasteless eating, and I would rarely finish a meal with any leftovers; however, even in the dining halls at UCSB can I see entire plates of food being thrown away, and huge amounts of trash piled up everywhere. 
       <br><br>

If you are in the same generation as mine, I ask you to do one simple thing: DON'T WASTE. I've mentioned this before in one of my previous comments; it's actually a quote from Sir David Attenborough, whose commentary witnessed the tragic effects of climate change around the world. Our generation needs to stop wasting food and commercial purchases, and that's not a limit on one's freedom: in fact, only when we save our planet from the ongoing climate crisis, do we really protect the freedom for our succeeding generations!

Upon deciding where I wanted to attend university, I had visited UCSB and was fascinated by their general awareness of needing to be better for the environment. This video (and course as a whole) was great in terms of educating people on changes we can all make to better the conditions of the planet. While listening to Ken’s lecture, I felt oddly familiar with each of the 5 things that I could be doing. Living in an apartment or compact housing is something I already do .I eat plant-based as often as I am able to—having switched off of dairy products and mostly eating vegetables and lentils. I love thrift shopping because there are many unique items and I know the the environment is doing better because of it. I only shop for new items if I absolutely need to or simply because I can’t always afford new sustainably sourced items. Growing up in a very materialistic home, it was difficult to move to college and realize how heavily I needed to downsize. I also realized how concerning my previous lifestyle had been. I was unaware of how many habits I had that hurt the environment. I took the ecological footprint quiz once in high school; my result was more than 2 Earths to sustain my life. However, I’m also taking Environmental Science 2 and I retook the quiz for an assignment in that class. I now require 1.4 Earths. It may seem insignificant, but if I was able to reduce my carbon footprint by at least 0.6, I know that I’ll be able get it down to just 1 Earth or hopefully even less. Commuting less, carpooling, biking, and public transportation are a few of the ways I’ve been able to better my lifestyle. Coming from a large family, I don’t plan on having another large family. I don’t think that I live the most sustainably, but I know that by continuing to educate myself, I’ll be able to keep helping the environment.



</p><hr>


<p>

I agree with 4 of your 5 recommendations to best live our lives to avert the climate crisis.  The one I disagree with is the limit on children.  
       <br><br>


First, from a scientific standpoint, the issue we are dealing with is population carrying capacity.  We currently have enough land, water, and food on our planet to support billions more people.  The biggest issue will be transporting these resources and ecological destruction for more houses, but those are issues we can solve through new technology and new ideas on housing.  The bigger issue of our carrying capacity is each individual's carbon footprint.  This is where we need to focus on the other 4 aspects to help save the planet.  If we all significantly reduce our carbon footprint, which I think will happen rapidly in the next two decades, than we should not have to worry about over-population.
       <br><br>


Second, I want to view this from a spiritual and moral side.  To me, it seems like we would be living in a dystopian, tyrannical  world if there was even a mere suggestion about how many kids is the right number to have.  While each individual family will have a perfect number for how many kids they will have, there should never be socially acceptable number, and there should be no government action, or even social shame for people who decide to have more or less than the "socially acceptable amount of kids".  The decision of how much life one wants to bring into this world far outweighs the marginal decline in climate wellbeing.

This lecture was very interesting to see. Unlike the other videos that Ken has shared with us, this one answers a very important question that many of us have been asking ourselves. “What can we do to help stop global warming?” Ken offers 5 very reasonable solutions that we can begin to do right away. For his first solution he states that we can use other means of transportations besides cars to get to our destination. This is a very simple solution, especially for us at UCSB who primarily use bicycles to get around. The second solution would take some getting used to. We are used to living in average sized homes that living in a micro apartment would be somewhat challenging in the future when you are planning to start a family. The third one is something that I am guilty of, which is wasting your food. There are times when I get a large meal thinking I will be able to finish it and end up throwing away what I don’t eat. Or other times I let my food go bad because I don’t finish it in time. This is something that I personally need to work on and I’m sure many others do too. His fourth solution was to have no more than one child per person. This to me isn’t that big of an issue, at least for the moment, since I’m not planning to have a very large family in the future. The fifth and final solution was to reduce the amount of clothing we buy and try to buy used clothing from thrift stores. Well personally I wouldn’t like to buy used clothing, but I don’t buy much clothing to begin with. I’m not very big on fashion and I only have about 10 shirts and 10 jeans in my closet anyways.
       <br><br>

Overall, I think his solutions are reasonable things that we can do. I can partly agree on the argument he shared that people made. People don’t want to give up their luxuries that they have worked so hard for; however, that would make us hypocrites. We argue that large companies are so greedy and want to maximize our profits that they don’t care about what the factories are doing to our environment. The only reason this happens is because we allow it. If we stop using their products, then they would stop producing and in result cut back on their carbon emissions.

The American “ideals” that older generations want to hold on to are going to continue to harm this planet so much. I wish they would take a second and think that are all those things going to really make them happy in the long run. I am glad that a lot of the younger generation is beginning to realize that by upcycling and using public transportation is so much better for the planet. As the professor said in the other video, knowledge is only power if you utilize it. My generation wants to utilize what we do know to make the planet more livable. 

       <br><br>

I wish more people would be willing to change their lives so our planet isn’t destroyed. As professor said most of these changes are small things we can do in our everyday lives. However, way too many people are attached to the “American dream” propaganda that the media feeds us. The few changes professor told us we can make in our life are essentially simple lifestyle changes. These changes are so small yet they would have a profound impact on our planet if more people implemented them.

I feel the same way about the American Dream. I was shown this in history class in middle school and thought that in America we have the freedom to do whatever we want. I had the mindset of not caring about the climate and just being free in this country. But now that I am taking this class, I feel that I was delusional and should care more about this earth. I am willing to do these changes and spread this idea to people to get them to understand what we need. to change and having the best things does not mean true happiness. True happiness is doing the right thing.


<br><hr>
I agree that we can all make lifestyle changes that can lesser our emissions and food print on the planet. I feel like all of those 5 things mentioned can be achieved. But I think it's hard as Professor mentioned that the past generation consuming styles, infrastructure, development make it so easy to buy things, to get around places with cars. I have been trying not to eat beef at the dinning commons, I haven't really gone shopping , I don't plan to have a big family , and an apartment community sounds sweet, but I think it's going to be a challenge for me to not own a car. hopefully , the transit system becomes more efficient, more buses, in where I live (San Jose)

After watching the “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?”, unlike voting, activism mentioned in the previous segment, I find that Professor Ken provided us more personal approaches to mitigate the climate crisis this time. Basically, Professor Ken suggested 5 simple approaches to decrease the climate footprint. To begin with, transportation is one of the greenhouse gas producers. Cars are the most common tools people used in their daily life. Using public transportation, bike, and walk is a better choice for green earth. For me, mostly I commute by walking and taking the bus. And I find that most students in UCSB do skateboarding and biking. The second one is living in micro apartments or cohousing community. From my perspective, I do not like living with strangers, so I would not try cohousing. Nonetheless, I would try not to pursue big house like mansion, which do harm to the environment. Third, cutting down the food waste and forming plant-based diet is something I am doing now. Though my original intention for eating veggies is to lose weight, I feel more energetic and healthier after changing my diet. So I will keep doing this. Fourth, having at most one child per person. Due to the sudden increase of global population, people need to slow down it by having fewer children. I think it is kind of infeasible in some countries. Some developed countries like France has already met aging population problem in their society. It is a need for them to have more new blood to maintain social operation. The last one is people’s want for stuffs. In my opinion, it is something related to the second way. If people live in smaller house, they will buy fewer product. Finally, Professor Ken compared the attitudes to these 5 approaches of different generations. It is obvious that younger generations have more consciousness of protecting environment than the elder generation. I feel that we have the responsibility to protect the environment. Luckily, I can enroll in this class to learn more about climate crisis.

<p>
Something very powerful that Ken said in this video was that “the generation currently controlling our planet has been settling into a way of life—for decades— that is an environmental nightmare.” He then followed with “what’s more, my generation likes it.” I realized that we indeed can be the generation to make this change. It also made me realize that this can’t be accomplished by merely small adjustments to our lives. What we’re comfortable with is ruining the environment. What we think is a “normal” way of living, is actually putting all of us, as well as the rest of the world in danger. Though, like Ken said, past generations are comfortable, and even proud of what they’ve accomplished, we can change the environmentally harmful ways implemented from our past. 
       <br><br>

This video was especially informative because it wasn’t just about presenting facts that support climate change. We are presented with actual solutions and ways that our generation can make a difference in this world.  It might seem like one person’s actions won’t have any influence but small numbers add up and we must start somewhere. There are so many people in this world that a consistent, yet small change in masses of people can be extremely effective. If we make major changes in our lives that decrease our carbon footprint, we can make up for these generations.

<p>

I personally found Ken’s lecture on ways that younger generations can help mitigate climate change to be both helpful and insightful, but also validating for opinions I’ve held on how to live my life that people around me back home don’t really get. This especially pertains to the idea of having children versus not having kids in the future. I’m an only child, and nearly all the members of my family have had relatively small families themselves. I don’t really feel the desire to ever have kids of my own, but my parents, especially my mom, love the idea of big families. Because of the fact that I’m their only kid, and I know how hard it was for them to have me, I feel like in a way I’m obligated to give them at least some sense of a large family. But this goes against what I want for myself, and I feel even more inclined to stick to my desire to not have kids because of how overpopulated the Earth is, and how far we’re stretching the limited natural resource supply. 
       <br><br>

I also liked how approachable Ken made each suggestion seem. I think it can be very easy to find climate change as a daunting task to fix, and though it is as a whole, the little things we as individuals can do to make a big impact aren’t as daunting as we may originally think. Ken suggests things like simply using personal cars less and utilizing walking, biking, or mass transport instead; cutting down your intake of beef and switching to more plant-based meals; shopping for less goods or for second-hand clothes/goods instead of consistently buying new items in large quantities; etc. It makes the challenge of helping the climate crisis more simple and less intimidating. I think a lot of people feel like we need to totally renovate our whole lives in order to help the climate, or become like one huge hippie community (nothing wrong with that though), but it doesn’t need to be as drastic as that. Even small changes help in huge ways.

It is definitely necessary to come up with more ideas to save the earth by our young generations. Also, I think in this lecture video, most of suggestions are reasonable, and even some of them have already been used in our real lives. In china, limited pregnancy has created many kinds of benefits before. In this way, from my perspective, the most important way is telling more people the truth of the dangerous situation of the climate change and show them the data of how the earth has changed and how it is going to be in the future or maybe several years. Thereby, more people can be motivated and then more solutions are able to be collected. What’s more, I think setting up courses that introduce environment problem in schools is really important, especially in primary school or middle school, because at their age, the information about the environment is more attractive than the math or other knowledge. Moreover, these students can be more creative that adult, sometimes their solutions can also be the efficient way to sae the earth.

American lifestyle is still the goal of most people around the world. To be honest, I was a little surprised when I heard some of Ken’s students have already began to change their lifestyles such as their diet, transportations and living standards to somewhat protect the environment. Because in China, people are still in the progress of achieving the American lifestyle, which means most of Chinese people are now processing the procedure of enjoying the benefits from damaging the environment just like Americans did in the last century. More importantly, they do not think they are wrong because they have the stereotypes that Americans live like this, drive like this, eat like this, etc. For example, Chinese people now are also expanding their homes, shopping new items often. Among the five things, in my opinion, the transportation option is not that hard. For people live in cities, they definitely should take public transportations because they are even faster than the cars during the terrible traffic. For people not live in cities, i don’t think they will stop driving immediately; but at least, they could choose to drive electric cars such as Tesla.

Before watching this video I had already decided to try to cut certain foods out of my diet, I won’t be able to go full plant based just yet but decided to cut cut out beef, and palm oil products. I was on the fence about commuting by bike to and from work in the future after graduating, but upon seeing that I could cut out twenty-five percent of my carbon footprint by doing just that, have decided to make the switch. I already tend to wear clothing items till they are too ragged to wear due to economic reasons, so that will not be as hard for me; however, I do have a bad habit of throwing away things when I move,due to space, that could be sold or given away, so I will need to work on that. I realise that everything we do has an impact on the environment and the future looks daunting. There is no way that we could get everyone on board to live this way. There are too many people in the world who justify their behavior towards the environment by stating things like, “How will one person’s actions really make a difference so I can still do this”. If everyone thinks that someone else will reduce the problem, then know one is actually creating solutions, and are instead just causing more damage. It is like when people do not believe that they need to vote because they think their one vote won’t really matter, then so many people end up thinking that way, that it actually does matter.

I really liked this lecture video because unlike a majority of the things we read/watch for this class, it doesn't only focus on the problem and the millions of things going wrong, but also offers us some solutions. Often I find myself overwhelmed by the situations climate change forces upon us, but I feel much better knowing that through these 5 simple life changes I can make a huge difference. I was surprised to see how many of these I have already changed, for example, as I am now living in Isla Vista where everything is more local and I have no need to use a car everyday like I would back home. I also have a number of food options that can allow me to cut out certain meats that are comparably worse than others, e.g. beef. I do wish there was a way to go back in time and wake up the past generations so that they can realize they're actions are going to cause countless numbers of problems in the decades to come, and that she time to change is now. But nonetheless I plan on taking my role in this new age of fighting the climate crisis seriously and hope that everyone will soon follow suit and together give our planet a future.

As ordinary people, what we can do in life is to be environmentally friendly in every little thing, take a car less, use plastic products less, take time to sort out garbage, save water and electricity, etc. Everyone does it Accumulating less is more natural. In short, you must have the awareness of environmental protection and participate in environmental protection activities. Those who do n’t say much about environmental protection will naturally look for new energy, clean energy, and chemical fossil fuels. Must be eliminated, this is the source of pollution, of course, this is a more important thing for the country and scientists and entrepreneurs, environmental awareness. Our next generation is our heritage, and whether we can complete the new lifestyle well, the key lies in how we educate the next generation. We must let them have an environmental awareness in their minds from an early age and let them naturally live an environmentally friendly life

As a kid all I can think about was living in a huge mansion. That was my definition of being successful; of being a true American. Growing up with a family of eight and living in a three bedroom apartment really made me desire a house with seemingly unlimited space. However, after watching this lecture I realized just how unnecessary it would be to live in a huge house when I’ve been sharing bedrooms and living in a cramped space my entire life. It wouldn’t hurt to continue with that lifestyle, after all that’s all I’ve ever known. I don’t need to live in a mansion, I just want to. That’s the kind of thing that many people nowadays have trouble distinguishing between, especially the younger generations. Many of us, including myself, are very materialistic and have yet to understand how much of an environmental impact each and every one of our actions have. All we ever think about is designer. Gucci this, Versace that. But for what? For it to be thrown away once a new line of clothing arrives? 
       <br><br>

At first glance I would unfortunately say that my generation is pretty much hopeless. However, after sitting in lectures and seeing just how much potential we really have makes me hopeful for the future. We have the pleasure to be guided by someone from an older generation who acknowledges the fact that his generation has driven us to a corner and is willing to help us escape. Although these five steps may seem easy to achieve, it is almost certain that hardships will come with it, especially since most of our lives revolve around the consumption of meat. However, we can all persevere through it.  I myself will attempt to follow these steps because I know for a fact that it’s all for the better. This is where we ultimately break the cycle, this is where we adopt new values and teach our loved ones the right way to live.

I’m glad that Ken is finally discussing in depth the ways we can help mitigate climate change. I found the five ways he mentioned very interesting and I am already utilizing some of those ways to decrease my carbon footprint. I am currently taking the class Environmental Science 2 and we recently had to take an Ecological Footprint quiz. I scored 2.8 Earths, meaning that if everyone lived like me, then they’d need 2.8 Earths each in order to provide enough resources to sustain them. Although the quiz explained that it was impossible to score 1 earth, I was disheartened that mine was that high. Because of ENV S 2 and this class, I try to live more sustainably now in order to reduce my ecological impact. As 54% of my ecological impact is food related, I try to decrease my footprint by eating more sustainably and wasting less food. Also, I lessened my intake of beef, which also decreases my footprint. I think I will also try to eat more vegetarian foods from now on.

I found it disappointing, but not surprising, that the older generation is so insensitive to change. I’m glad that classes like this one exists so it can teach the younger generation the dangers of climate change and how to lessen its impact.

I also really appreciate the fact that Ken is discussing the ways that we can help in the fight against climate change. I feel like a lot of the time, people advocate for "going green" and "saving the planet" without actually putting action to their words. I too, am taking the ways he mentioned to heart and have integrated them into decreasing my harmful impact on the planet. Last year, I also took the Ecological Footprint quiz and while my number was much lower than my peers because of some of my lifestyle choices, seeing how I didn't see a single person with a number equaling even close to 1 really put things in perspective for me. We are not living sustainably, especially in the United States. Something that really stood out to me in one of Ken's lectures this week was the concept of moral laziness. I haven't eaten meat in almost three years, I never use plastic water bottles, I'm wary with my water usage, and I take recycling very seriously. Even with these steps, I still find myself doing things I know I shouldn't just because it's easier. Humankind's way of life so far has been very unsustainable and we need to change even though these changes are foreign and hard. I agree that it's disappointing the older generation is insensitive to progression, but we as a younger generation have the responsibility to be the first to make these changes, even small ones, whenever we can.

I found Ken’s closing statement “knowledge is only power when it is acted upon” to be extremely profound and relevant to my generation in particular. Yes, our generation is much more open-minded and knowledgeable in regard to the climate catastrophe - yet an underwhelming number of us actually implement this knowledge into our daily lives. As Ken stated, making a few small changes, such as following a plant-based diet and limiting purchases as a consumer can have a very significant impact on your carbon footprint. However, I have watched many of my peers ignore this knowledge, and fail to make any lifestyle changes to actually make any personal difference. I hope that this is simply a side effect of youthful naivety, and not a pattern that we’ve inherited from the previous generation. Being aware of the severity of the scale of the climate catastrophe and failing to act seems almost criminal to me, and I hope that my generation will be the ones to break this cycle of ignorance and actual implement change on a personal and institutional level. 

       <br><br>

I agree with Ken, that choosing to live sustainably does sound both exciting and desirable, and if given the opportunity, so would the rest of the younger generations. Our mutual open-mindedness in the presence of new ideas and solutions is what makes our generation unique and is what will make it possible for us to spark global change.

This video honestly related to everything I have done in the past years. What professor Ken mentions in this video are all things I am guilty of doing. I have contributed to the climate crisis to an extent, and honestly feel guilty of it. I too have dreamt of having a luxury home, a car, etc. like everyone else in my generation and the one before us. It is just part of the dream and the grind; working hard to achieve your goals in life. However these dreams of mine come at a great cost; they affect the environment. Like Ken mentioned, we can help improve the environment by having smaller homes, changing our diet, using public transportation, biking, or walking to our destinations, etc. More than ever we need to realize that our dreams of having this luxurious lifestyle in the near future should be replaced for the benefit of our planet. Sure we want what is best in our lives, what we didn’t grow up with, we want that new clothing piece, that new IPhone, that new sports car, that beautiful mansion, but it all comes at a cost. This is the cost of ruining the planet we live in. We still have time to save the planet before its too late, and it is something that has gotten me to think about changing my dreams and lifestyle for one that will improve our planet, rather than one that will continue to speed up the climate crisis.

Professor Ken’s lecture, “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do” gave me a very good insight of 5 simple things that we as a generation can do to significantly lower our CO2 emissions. These suggestions do not seem very difficult to follow and sound very logical. I personally have taken it upon myself to not own a car but use mass transit or walk to my destinations and make it a point to rarely use a car. However I feel like housing suggestion is a more difficult issue for me. I’ve grown up living in garages and want a house to call home for my family and I. I don’t want a huge house but I would like to own a small house for my family and I because we never had that luxury. I understand that it is our need for more luxuries that put us in this mess to begin with so i'm going to have to find a solution for this issue. My meat consumption is very low and I plan on having only 1 or maybe no children at all. I do agree with Professor Ken in that consumer culture is very ugly and needs to be stopped. However, I believe this will be a very difficult fight seeing as the older generations view these changes as the removal of their freedoms. It is a very American thing to fight for your “freedoms” but at what cost will we continue to fight for the freedom to exploit our planet for goods?

At the beginning of the quarter the class seemed very grim and that our planet is finally caving into the lack of respect that it has endured over the years. When he gave the 5 simple ways we can all reduce our carbon footprint I was shocked at how simple the actions were. I expected things to be more complicated such as coming up with new renewable resources. 

       <br><br>

As I thought longer though, these actions are easier said than done. We as a species are very selfish and materialistic, but I don't think its worse anywhere else on the planet than here in the U.S. We aren't willing to live in tiny apartments, eat a plant-based diet, use public transport, buy less materialistic things, etc. The desire to have a life of luxury is greater than the desire to save the planet, myself included. It will definitely take some adjustment, but once we all realize what's at stake then I believe these changes can be made.

Out of all of the videos I have seen from Ken, this one is by far the most informative. I feel like this video really targeted one of the major issues of fighting back against climate change. As individuals facing a global threat, it's hard for us to even start processing what we could do to mitigate this crisis. As Ken mentions, the population worldwide has reached 7.7 billion people. Even if some individuals are actually willing to alter their lifestyles to resolve this issue they might be discouraged because they don't feel like they will have an actual impact on the world by doing so. A lot of people and corporations worldwide are still pumping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, so why should those people go through the effort of reducing their carbon footprints if so many other people aren't taking that initiative?

       <br><br>

The logical question that follows is what impact could I possibly have on the environment if I am acting alone. Despite Ken's great ideas for reducing carbon emissions such as using communal transport and avoiding having more than 2 children, I really believe that we will not make significant progress until we act together to mitigate this crisis. One of the reasons why I believe this movement has gotten so much attention is because of protesting. At the end of the day, what's going to make the bigger impact: people acting individually to reduce their carbon footprint or large groups of people protesting against industries polluting our atmosphere while motivating each other to reduce each other's carbon footprints? Within an organization or group, people are most likely to stick to their cause because they feel motivated by working with others and also consequently cannot slack off as easily. On an individual basis, there is nobody there to motivate you to stick to reducing global warming's consequences.

This lecture, “can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?” was very intriguing to me, due to the impressive influx of damaging information Ken provided, notably regarding his generations’ refusal to change for selfish reasons. I appreciate his display of common responses he gets when asking individuals in this generation how they feel about making the five major lifestyle adjustments to combat climate change. I liked the quote, “We have a voracious appetite for meat and all sorts of stuff.”  In particular, I appreciated the acknowledgement that hard-working Americans crave indulgence as a reward for their labor, but I think that our mentality, more so than our bank accounts, is why we purchase such massive homes and spend outlandishly at malls. 
       <br><br>

I am in a social psychology class, and we recently learned about the difference between an independent mindset and an interdependent mindset. Basically, when possessing an independent mindset, you behave in a way that elevates your self-image and progress towards your personal goals. On the other hand, interdependent individuals often work to elevate the people around them, or that belong in their close ties. Interestingly, studies have been done to demonstrate how culture influences having either an independent or interdependent mindset, and East Asian cultures significantly display interdependence, while America reigns independence. If we weren’t so inherently selfish and tried to condition our thoughts towards collaboration and empathy, maybe there would not be such a deep divide between us and other countries in giving up consumption patterns. After all, we are responsible for 25% of the world’s greenhouse gases, but have a much smaller population than other countries that aren’t contributing nearly that quantity.

This lecture video brings me some new perspective for the climate change. Before watching this video, I only know that there are some human behaviors that will lead to the climate change, such as: burning fossil fuels, driving more cars. The reason behind it is that those behaviors will definitely increase the amount of carbon dioxide and other global warming gases in the atmosphere. However, after looking through this video, there are three points I need to consider. The first one is that transportation. Nowadays, there are more and more people live in the big cities, in this case, the public and private transportation have become more and more important. Actually, more transportation we uses, more carbon dioxide we will release. However, we cannot prevent and stop all the transportation. The only thing we can do is that choose to take public transportation instead of private one. The second one is housing. To be honest, I did not completely understand about this point. I did not think that live in a big house or small department will have any difference for the climate change. The third point is waste less food. I want to related this one to a real situation in China. When people eat in restaurants, we get used to taking the rest food. If we take it, we will use some unrecycle  boxes. These boxes will be finally drop into the trash bin. The only way to treat those boxes is burning. As you can think, burning will definitely rise up the rate of climate change.

The question of “what can I do to reduce my climate footprint?” is one that I have certainly asked and I believe most others have too. It is devastating to learn of all the destruction we do to our own planet and clearly we need legal changes and large scale societal transformation, but people often want a more concrete, personal, and monitorable way of making a change. Many of these changes are challenging and it may require time to adapt to such drastic lifestyle switches, but they are also totally doable, and serve as methods of bettering yourself that are easily kept track of. The grand impact these changes have should serve as a source of inspiration to challenge yourself to self improvement

       <br><br>

I found it interesting to hear about how much easier it is to reduce ones carbon footprint in an urban environment. I have always thought of cities as large pollution sources. Living in Los Angeles smog layer always reminded me how poor our city air quality is, and when visiting family in Manhattan I always saw the city and dirty as trash infested. After listening to the video however it is immediately clear how living in a city can help one reduce their personal effect on the environment. While a more dense population may lead to a more concentrated area of pollutants, it makes sense that each individuals waste is, or at least can be, much lower.

I also have asked myself in the past on what I can do to help reduce the impact I have on the planet. As a kid we were told things such as not to litter and to recycle properly, but in this video Ken tells us ways we as young adults can reduce our footprint. Most of the things he went over seem quite harsh and a huge change for someone who never took this changes into account. I can also see how people would be quick to refute this changes and continue to live the lives they envisioned. These changes are only seen drastic by an average American and I guarantee you that citizens of other countries are already following most of these guidelines while being unaware of climate change.

To start off, I feel very relieved about how confident Ken is when it comes to our generation making positive changes to our lives that will help prevent further contribution towards climate change. Next, I will say that I am guilty of wasting plenty of food in the past. I am not proud of it and this video opened my eyes on what my wasteful actions are doing. I feel even more terrible about it than I already did and will undoubtedly make an immediate change to that aspect of my life. I was shocked to learn that 1lb of beef can translate to 30lbs of lentils. Not only are we doing our earth wrong with all this production of meat, but it isn't doing any good for our bodies either. We might as well help our bodies if that means it will help our precious earth as well. Although I 100% agree with Ken on his statements about climate change and what we can do to prevent any further damage, I wasn't a big fan of his suggestion of having just 1 to 2 children per family. I am a very religious person and stand by the religious responsibility of reproducing. From a young age I have been taught how big of a deed it is to have many kids. This is not necessarily a negative thing if you raise your children to care about the earth and promote healthy and positive habits.

I completely understand where you are coming from about having more than 1-2 kids. The friends I grew up with in high school all come from large families, and so do I. So, I agree with you that it doesn't have to be a negative thing if we are more responsible in our way of living in terms of the other area's Professor Hiltner suggested. And although there may be 1-2 changes that he suggest that people are not going to agree with, I think that we should then redirect our effort even more into other changes that we can make that fit with our beliefs. I really appreciated Professor Hiltner giving concrete actions that we can take, besides the typical one I always hear of "educating the youth" While I think this is very important, I always find myself wondering what more I can do. Now that I've become more educated on the causes and consequences of climate change, how can I start making a difference today?

"A house is a pile of stuff with a roof on it." - George Carlin

       <br><br>

Many, especially those of older generations, attribute the larger houses, car culture, and consumerism to "increased quality of life". While this may be partially true, this statement requires further investigation. I suggest that many of those benefits, especially larger homes and larger families, are not actually contributing to our happiness, and that this excess in fact reduces our quality of life on a more fundamental level. As the quote above shows, the larger the house you have, the more stuff you can put in there. By stuff, I mean consumer goods. The stresses on the environment necessarily increase with larger houses, since there is more space to heat or cool, more lights, more electricity use in general. Every extra consumer good under that roof also contributes. While these things are "nice", the main thing to note is that money simply can't buy happiness. After a certain threshold, where paying the bills for basic needs like food, housing, or medicine is no longer a major concern, happiness has been shown to not really increase. Many people anecdotally report a sense of emptiness after a big consumer good purchase as well. In other words, you have the thing you've been saving for, but did it really fulfill you? Most likely not. 
       <br><br>


This excess also provides Americans with the opportunity to engage in the commute. After all, space for 4000+ sq. ft. houses is only in the suburbs. Commuting is a truly soul-crushing, body-destroying 20th century invention. It becomes immediately clear after a long drive that the position is unnatural to sit in at best. This also contributes to the dangers of car culture and the effect that is has on our mood. It has been shown that getting into a vehicle inclines us to become more angry and less empathetic. What else would happen when a person is placed in a multi-ton, high speed metal cage? While it is certainly not possible for everyone to move to the city, many more can move into or closer to a city. Public transit and bicycle commuting is far better for the environment and the body.

It is cool that your response addresses reasons besides the climate crisis that we should change our lifestyles. I agree that there is a point beyond necessity where consumption doesn't actually better our lives or make us happier. Stress is damaging health all over the world because of the value we place on material possessions and what they can communicate about our success. There is a mindset in America that links levels of wealth to certain material objects and people who prioritize "success" are constantly working toward owning the most expensive things that will communicate to everyone else how well they are doing. It is sad because many people will work toward this goal at the cost of their health and their connections to the people and world around them. Like being in a car makes us more angry and less empathetic, I think many of our norms today prioritize independence and status and neglect the importance of connection. I am hopeful and looking forward to the changes we will have to make to save the planet that will bring us closer together and make us more connected. Instead of sitting in our mansions alone, driving everywhere alone, and eating food that we know very little about, we will be living closer to other people, and traveling with other people. By understanding the impact of our food systems, we will shift toward more sustainable diets and we will be more connected to our food. There are so many good things about these lifestyle changes that can have such an impact and I am glad to hear from Ken that so many people our age are excited about them and so willing to adopt them or make them a part of their future plans.


<br><Hr>
I agree with you! Our parents' generation cares about houses and cars. I've heard so many stories about the first thing a person would do when he/she become rich is to buy a new, fancy house or car. People of the last generation purchased those properties to "increase" their life, but they actually don't really need it. And I would say consumerism is not a good thing for us. The idea of it made us keep purchasing things which are not necessities for our life and make a lot of waste. One way to reduce the chance of making this mistake could be asking ourselves "do we really need this thing" or "do I own something similar to it". I learned these two pre-shopping questions from another class, but I found they actually worked for me. I gradually stop buying clothes, shoes, and other things I don't need that much. I saved money and avoided wasting.

I just want to say Ken this was a fantastic and informative lecture. I am a vegetarian myself and funny enough when I was doing it for the animal suffering I was pretty consistent but ate meat once a month or so and didn't see a problem with it. But now, after taking an environmental ethics class and writing a 12 page paper on the ethics of eating meat, I was able to fully see the environmental and climate impact eating meat has and how humans are going to be greatly affected by climate change. And as mentioned in the video food production is the second largest global contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. I am very firm in my commitment to never eating meat again no exceptions. I love the research you brought in about 1LB of beef having the same emissions as 30LB of lentils! These are the types of facts that really made me really see how immoral eating meat is. Did you also know that 10 LBS of beef uses 25,000 gallons of fresh water, the same amount an average American family drinks in a whole year? This is such an inefficient food system we have to produce meat. On average it takes 20LBS of grains to make 1LB of beef and 2500 gallons of fresh water to produce 1LB of beef. All of these resources could go to so much better uses like to the poor who could greatly benefit. And this would significantly reduce our emissions if factory farmed meet stop existing. I really went into detail on the immorality of contributing to this inefficient food production of producing meat in my essay.
       <br><br>
There is one point you mentioned that the older generation say that the solutions you proposed are "a direct assault on the American way of life”  and that it sound like communism and it interferes with what we call freedom. And this is the classic libertarian argument: these restrictions impose on American freedom. I would counter this, and I would say the freedom to buy meat (or do anything really that harms the environment) is taking away from many other moral beings’ freedom. One, the freedom to live a happy life or no life (rather than a torturous one) is taken away from animals by one's freedom to eat meat. Two and most importantly, the freedom of future generations is limited as the climate deteriorates. Billions of people will not have the same food, water, and livable land as a result of the  large greenhouse gas emissions and an overheated planet, and these basic necessities are required for full freedom.  And three, you are preventing the most vulnerable from attaining enough of their physical needs by contributing to an inefficient food production system (remember the grain and freshwater stats?). And, to further hammer it home, by not acting in a way that prevents climate deterioration, you are disproportionally taking away the poor's (who already don't have alot of freedom) freedom because the consequences of climate change will hit them the hardest. So just be aware you're freedom  to buy a big house, nice car, and to eat meat, is taking away from many other moral beings freedom, including future generations, current generations, the poor, and many more. You are just one person. You're freedom is not worth anymore than the generations of harm your emissions will cause. End of story

In the video “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?” Ken explains the five things he believes are the most crucial to mitigate climate change know that we have to reduce our carbon footprint in the planet, especially when the pupation is growing at such a fast rate. As of now, one of our biggest problems is climate crisis and in a near future it will be both overpopulation and climate crisis. The five things Ken talked about were: transportation, housing, food waste, population growth and our tendency to buy things we don’t need. In order to bring a change to our world, we need to individually change what we do in life. For example, changing from a private-owned vehicle to public transport could significantly reduce carbon footprint by 1/4. `Also, changing to a plant-based diet is a good idea. This could potentially reduce food waste in the United States and again reduce the carbon footprint. The overall goal of these five-points Ken talked about is to individually reduce carbon footprint which by itself looks like it’s not enough. However, when more people around the world joins this cause as well, then and just then, we could see the overall change in the reduction of greenhouse gases. The last generation failed to work together to prevent climate change. Now, Ken is telling us that we shouldn’t be committing the same mistake as they did because then it would be too late for humanity. The earth belongs to all of us, and It is in our best interest to take care of it. If we don’t work collectively as a population, then there will be nothing to stop climate change and its terrific consequences. 
       <br><br>
 Another thing I want to point out is the different responses received from different generations. As expected, Ken’s generation dislikes the idea of living the way Ken explained. For them, this would be “horrific.” I feel like most of them just think about themselves and not the future of their kids. Most of them care about living comfortably without changing the way they have been living. Whereas my generation is more proactive. They see these changes as something doable and reasonable. As part of this generation, I can see myself adopting all these changes. It might take some time to adapt to these changes but there’s no other alternative. If we don’t act now, then it will be too late for us. I can only say that Ken’s generations are far from caring about our future. I am not saying that all of them are, but most of them just care about how they are living today. After all, they will not be here when things get uglier. Therefore, we have to look out for ourselves and protect the next generation of humans that will inherit the earth. We should start by implementing Ken’s ideas to our daily lives and by transmitting these same ideas to our family, friends, and other people around the world. Yes, change takes time, which we lack right now but there’s still hope for us if we start working as soon as possible. Ken’s generations serve as a cautionary tale for us and we decide whether we want to change or not.

Everyone can do little things that combined can make a huge difference on the global carbon footprint of humans. The previous generations have been addicted to fossil fuels in order provide economic and technological advances, however, this has had a huge impact on the climate crisis we are starting to live through today.
       <br><br>
We can adjust our lives to green living to protect our planet, as Ken suggested, we can stop driving cars, move to a smaller living space, switch to a plant based diet and waste less product, and have less children, therefore reducing the global population. As we have seen recently the birth rates are stabilizing, most of the population increase in the next decades will be due to a higher number of elderly people and people between the ages of 18 to 49, but the bracket of population between the ages of 0-15 years old will have stabilized and remain at 2 billion people, the number it is now. 
       <br><br>
But most people do not think of their carbon footprint when they go shopping or order a meal. Many of us are also not willing to change our lives so drastically, people are morally lazy. For example, they like burgers so they are not willing to become vegetarian. They are not willing to move to a city to remove a car from their daily lives because it would complicate things for them. They like their large houses and are not willing to move to an apartment or a smaller house. 
       <br><br>
But if we don't do something to mitigate our carbon footprint and slow down climate change, we won't have many livable places left on the planet, and it is up to our generation to stop the damage of the previous generations.

These two videos just show how easy it is to change our ways. It isn’t that hard to bike places instead of driving. Ken does it! I think a major thing we need to change is the fast fashion business. There are so many online stores now a days that appeal to the teenagers because the clothes are so cheap. There’s a reason there so cheap! I feel like one good thing about our generation though is thrifting has become more popular. At least where i’m from. A lot of people my age go thrifting with there friends and will create new oufits out of the clothes they find. After watching these videos I realized how easy it is to change my ways and to play my part in stopping climate change. I always thought that I don’t play that big of part in it because there are 7.5 billion people in this world but after watching this video I realized that’s not true! If everyone has that mindset I had then nothing will ever get done.

The “American dream” and ideals that we as a society have set rely heavily on things that are killing our planet. Lavish houses and multi-car households filled to the brim with “stuff” are seen as a goal for many.  For this reason, a large societal change will be difficult but it is the only way to undo the damage that has already been done. The generation that caused this problem is also the one that set these goals and taught them to younger generations, making it seem like an endless cycle. The fact that younger generations have responded well to the five simple tasks that could decrease an individual's carbon footprint makes me feel a tinge of hope. But the generations before lack of accountability and taking responsibility for what they have done burns out that flame of hopefulness.  This crisis needs to be one of unity that brings all of us together to save the thing that sustains us all, our beautiful planet.  Five goals, that’s it, all of them can be counted on just one hand, five simple goals. Many people set more than five resolutions at the beginning of each new year if each person did just one or two of the above-listed suggestions as their goal for this year that could make a great impact.  Passing on the problematic habits of a society that is killing the planet is not an option for my generation, we have a responsibility to create a new generation of climate warriors as well as to convince older generations that it is their responsibility to clean up their mess, or at least to stay out of our way while we clean it up for them.

I completely agree with you. "The American Dream" includes many things that harm our planet one way or another like owning many cars which contributes heavily to all the CO2 release. As you said, "The American Dream" was idealized heavily and created by our past generation, yet most of them are careless. It is going to be really hard to change these beliefs as they have been jammed into our brain so we always chase this "dream."
       <br><br>

There is some hope, however, it is important that our generation of kids follows these small 5 goals in order to help control somewhat the CO2 release. One of the most important things in my opinion that I think we should acknowledge is cars. I think there are many times where one can bike to the store for example, but the average person would rather drive because they are lazy.

To be honest, the 'American Dream' is a mindset that not only do us Americans have, but also the world. I feel that the 'American Dream' is actually human nature, as there are many others around the world who strive to be greater than the others. As long as human nature exists, I feel like it will be very hard, if not impossible, to change the consumerist monster that lives in all of us. As a society, we need to band together and find a way to reduce our everyday things we buy, as I feel like that will be our greatest challenge to overcome.
<br><hr>
I agree with you. America is based on the idea of "The American Dream", which is that with hard work comes success. The previous generation, Ken's generation, has defined success as luxury cars, homes, and other stuff. Success is defined as the ability to buy items that we want, not need, which is bad for our environment. The previous generation has taught our generation this, and although we are making steps towards the right direction, like using less animal products etc, we still are chasing the "American Dream" of luxury. To do the five things Ken told us to do means to go against generations of teaching, which will be one of the hardest things to do, but it is definitely not impossible.
<br><hr>
I like how you started this comment with the concept of the "American Dream". The ideals and values that have been passed down by the very people who caused most of the climate crisis are why I believe it is so hard for so many people to want to make change, even in our generation. It seems like there is no end to this cycle like you have said and the five things that Ken says we can do to change them to sound radical, however if people were to accomplish at least one of these things I could not even imagine the difference that would make in the world. It also encourages me that our, younger, generations, are responding well to the changes that Ken presents. I do not think it will be easy because of how set in our ways we have become and who hard the generations above us like to dwell on materialistic objects. 
       <br><br>

I think that one important topic that was discussed was the increase in house size and how it has gone up in recent years. Housing cannot continue to increase at this rate because the planet will simply not be able to sustain this increased level anthropogenic pollution. In Kens generation alone he has talked about how bad the climate crisis has become only in his life time. 
       <br><br>

I am hopeful that we will be able to combat the climate crisis through doing things such as the five ways to act that Ken describes. I believe holding a positive and optimistic attitude about fighting this issue will also be a key factor in gaining more people to be on board with turning the current state of our planet around.

I appreciate how this video was actually helpful and gave good advice on how to reduce our carbon footprint. I feel like these tips are mostly easy to follow if you set your mind on it. However, because of the ideals the last generation set and how they raised their kids, most people today may find it hard to give these things up because they might see it as some of their goals in life, to buy a big house or have a large family. I agree with your statement that unity is needed in order to actually help reduce the carbon footprint for all of us and better our planet. I also liked how you emphasized that it is important for the older generation to help us out or stay out of the way, like when passing new laws. There are many legislators out there who are against passing laws that would actually help the climate crisis but instead they just want to keep helping out the fossil fuel companies so they can make a profit too, without any care for the planet’s future.

<br><hr>
I agree, our society does rely on many things that cause harm to our planet. I would be lying if I said I have never dreamed of having a huge house and a bunch of cars and just a bunch of stuff. After being in both English 22 and now English 23 my views on having a lifestyle like that have changed. I do agree that the generation that caused this issue has raised into wanting a “lavish” lifestyle, but there are still plenty of those that are apart of our generation that promote these lifestyles, such as famous young celebrities. As Ken has mentioned in class, Kylie Jenner is one of many. I agree that it would be extremely helpful if people tried their best to follow at least two of the suggested goals to help combat the climate crisis. Of course it would be great to do all five, but two is better than nothing.
<br><hr>
"Five goals, that’s it, all of them can be counted on just one hand, five simple goals." I love that you said this, Emma. It makes an approach to this issue seem so doable. Why can't it be that simple then? Why don't people just follow these things? It frustrates me so much!

<br><hr>
I agree our generation has become reliant on materialistic stuff and everyone strives ideals of success which include working towards buying a big house and nice car. Although it is only five tasks most people would much rather prefer their current comfort over trying to change their lifestyles for the sake of the planet.

<br><hr>
I agree. Not only do people try to buy these humongous houses and expensive cars to display their wealth, they spend ridiculous amounts of money on designer clothes and other materialistic items. I know freedom is one of main things the "American Dream" is truly about, but that doesn't justify all these large expenses on objects that cost a very small fraction to produce compared to the retail price displayed in stores. I do believe a lot of people from my generation have either started working on these 5 changes Ken talked about in his lecture video, or have already been doing them for a good amount of time. Making the effort into contributing these 5 changes into our every day lives would greatly impact our planet. Being able to cut our individual carbon footprints by at least 1/2 is already a really good amount. With plant-based diet lifestyles and thrifting for a new wardrobe seems to be the trends that are "in" nowadays, I can see that being a great start to a change for our planet's future.

The hardest part about saving our environment will be the minor, first steps of changes to the lifestyle our parent's generation worked hard to achieve and associate with freedom. I absolutely cannot blame them for working hard in life to be comfortable in retirement and reach their goals, some of which are definitely materialistic. It's so easy to associate success with money, unnecessary purchase, excessive possessions, wastefulness, all the supply with little personal demand for it. I have been blessed born into a well off family, and it is uncomfortable thinking about the sacrifices we will have to make. However, it is very justifiable because I just realized our carbon footprint is worse than others. Our generation has a daunting task to change this American-dream like big money moves engulfing all our wildest dreams, possessions, and wants of a luxurious way of living. 
       <br><br>

The good news is, once we make this significant culture change, it will only get easier and easier for the next generations to take it a step further. If todays youth does everything it can to motivate this country to do some of those 5 "reasonable" sacrifices, it will set a precedent for our posterity to follow. By looking at us as role models, they will do more to keep the ball rolling, be willing to influence more positive change. If we do 2 out of the 5 tasks in our generations prime governing the country, our kids will want to be better and do the next 3. the next generation, like dominos, will make an even bigger contribution. Once todays youth is deceased, our lasting impact on the planet will be teaching the future how to be better and leave this world better than you found it. What I'm saying is like the physics behind redirecting a boulder, it takes more energy to reverse the movement than it will to push the ball faster in the right direction. Like riding a bike, our generation needs to peddle in first gear, but imagine the monumental significance by the time the 7th generation gets the wheels spinning at the 7th gear, etc…

This video I think has helped me better understand what I can do now to help the planet. I also believe that the solutions Ken gave in the video are attainable. Honestly, these solutions seem to be so simple that it's hard to believe that the majority of people in the United States do not live their lives in these ways. However, I believe that people do not live their lives like this because of how they are raised. Growing up in central California I had a fairly large house, mostly because I grew up with two brothers and my parents, so when I moved to college I was worried about my living space. But to be honest, living in a smaller space has actually been almost freeing. I still have enough room to sleep and do homework. It also has made me really think about the things I buy because I have a lot less room to work with. So these sorts of life styles seem obtainable, however the majority of the older people in the generations before me do not seem to think so.

The reality is that if everyone went vegan or vegetarian, the carbon footprint in total would be cut by over half. This is a easy choice to make. Its simple just dont eat meat.  You cant claim to be considered for the environment if your eating burgers and red meat that are horrible for the enviroment. Another thing about this is that it is a DAILY EASY decision to make. Every person has their own free will and people just dont want to give up meat. It is hard to see people complaining about the environment while they eat a huge meat diet. The difference is that some people will just talk the talk but wont walk the walk. It is easy to just say that you want carbon emissions to go down. Anyone can just SAY it. But not everyone will actually DO something. And thats what seperates people who actually care. If your reading this and you want to make a difference, its simple, stop eating meat and your carbon footprint will cut in half. And its easy, just dont pick up that greasy burger thats bad for you anyways, and you save animals lives and stop the horrible meat industry, I believe this should be a WHOLE video for Ken, not just a little segment as it is actually the most important and easiest to implement for the students.

I found this video very informative in regards to the perspective of Ken's generation. Being born and raised in California, many of the people I know born in Ken's generation are very progressive thinkers, so I would not know about the rest of them in the United States. If it is true that the rest of them in the United States are not prepared, or not willing to take this major step we will have a big problem. Those who are stuck in their ways, and generally more conservative are usually wealthy. Without the wealthy Americans on board with the plan to reduce our carbon footprints, things may not get done. The majority of Millennials in the U.S. are already taking part in reducing their carbon footprints. For example, those of us who go to school at UCSB generally use a bike or skateboard to get around and do not use a car. Students are not living in mansions, and in fact pack houses to their max capacities. We are doing our best to be vocal about the climate crisis, whether it be online, or in the streets, protesting, just trying to get the message through the heads of those who are not aware of how bad the situation is. truly think the key to achieving an overall lower carbon footprint in the United States is to change the minds of Ken's generation. Whether this is through protests throughout the country, or personally convincing our elders to get on board... it must be done. We have heard of many instances in which people have changed their ways of life for the betterment of the planet. If it can be done by thousands of other people, it can be done by Ken's generation.

In this week's lecture videos, we continued to examine how the generation before us knew what would be the cost of their actions, but continued to burn fossil fuels at an alarming rate so as not to disrupt the lifestyles they had worked so hard to obtain.  As far back as the 1970s, Americans may not have known the extent of anthropogenic actions on the global climate, but they did know that there was an energy crisis and that they needed to cut back on their consumption of fossil fuels by a lot, which they also ignored.  They set us up to suffer in a mess of a world that they left behind because they could not fathom the idea of buying used clothes or giving up a large home that they bought with their hard earned money.  I understand that some of the solutions that Ken suggested are not all attractive to the average American adult, but some people are not willing to make any sacrifices on their way of life for the sake of the environment. 
        <br><br>

I understand that not everyone has the means or desires to implement all of these changes into their lives, but many people are not even making the little changes to try and reduce their carbon footprint.  An example of something that Ken can bring up is the idea of “flexitarianism”.  This is an easy lifestyle change where people go vegetarian or vegan when they can (whether that is a couple meals or days a week) to help start the transition to a more sustainable life.  People are more likely to begin and stick to smaller and more easily manageable lifestyle changes which can make a bigger impact if more people do it.

“If you hope to effectively mitigate our climate crisis, you need to embrace we can change.” Those are very harsh words to hear from our professor because most people simply can’t embrace the change; all this because their mindset is so set into stone that changing it is borderline impossible. About 76 million Americans are boomers, and 88.5 million are from generation X. That’s about 160 million Americans who most likely won’t change their lifestyles or their votes because of climate change. As Ken said in the video, they don’t want to give up the lifestyle they fought so hard to achieve and that will cost us deeply. Our generation can probably follow through with these basic 5 steps to reducing our carbon footprint, but can the other generations that are still sharing this planet with us do the same is the true question.

As someone who grew up in Los Angeles, I am used to seeing insane traffic and thousands upon thousands of cars in a freeway at a time. Although the primary means of transportation in LA is driving, I have always tried to use the metro bus or carpooling as much as possible. Is this because I don't own a car, myself? Perhaps it is, but I am still glad that my circumstances have allowed me to live more consciously of the environment whether I knew it or now. Upon watching this video, my first reaction was "wow, it's THAT easy to fix climate change?" Then when I rewatched the video and really thought about it, I realized that these are all big lifestyle changes that may be hard for people to make. I often find myself ordering too much at a restaurant and then ending up having to throw the rest away. Don't even get me started on how many clothes I purchase every month. However, when looking at the bigger picture, we just have to be more aware of our consumption and these are just a few sacrifices we have to make in order to protect our planet and avert the climate crisis. 

        <br><br>

I found it interesting how Ken said that there should be no more than one child per person. When I think about the overpopulation of our planet, I never really think about how that is one of the main reasons that so many have to live in poverty. As some are pushed out of the nice and habitable areas, others have to live in less desirable areas. And these people have to suffer the consequences of climate change the most. Additionally, I believe that adoption should be a bigger thing in our society. Aside from helping the environment by reducing overpopulation, you are also giving a child, who otherwise would've been alone, a family. 
        <br><br>


In regards to those who commented that they work hard for their things and lifestyle and shouldn't be told how to live a certain way: I think that it's perfectly fine to use your money however you want to, but not at the expense of other people's lives and not at the expense of our planet and environment. The American lifestyle is often overabundant and too excessive to sustain. I know because I can be this way at times. Speaking for this country, we need to start being more environmentally conscious in order to protect our world.

After finishing with Ken’s mini-lecture, “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?”, I have obtained a better understanding of how our generation could do specifically to mitigate the climate crisis and I started to feel lucky to enroll in this class. The lecture mainly mentions 5 ways of reducing carbon footprints and I found them very practical and straightforward. In the aspect of transportation, I’m grateful for what I’m doing now: to bike and take buses for commuting instead of calling an Uber. Diminishing personal carbon footprints probably wouldn’t make an impact to a larger scale, but if hundreds and thousands of people are doing it every day, it will definitely be a game-changer. For approach 2, I feel like it’s a little bit infeasible because, for those people who have settled down ever since their parents moved to where they are living in now, they might feel uncomfortable to move out of their homelands. I think this could only work out over a relatively long period of time as more and more people are being aware of the situation right now. Talking about food-waste problems, I commit my “crime” here: I sometimes pick up food in my free will without actually considering my level of consuming and result in a waste of extra food. After learning the third proposal, I decide to eat more vegetables instead of meat to be more flexible on my personal diet. About approach 4, it’s practically double-sided between reducing carbon footprints and lacking the labor force in the long run. Last but not least, keeping things longer would undoubtedly be right to me since my parents are paying a lot to support my advanced education and it’s much more environmentally friendly. The climate crisis is happening. Although we should follow such proposals like these, we also need to be critical to their practicabilities.

The 5 ways of reducing carbon footprints are definitely achievable for all humans. To start, we need to change our mode of transportation to bikes or buses so that we reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Another improvement we must make is eating more appropriately. We need to be smarter with the way we eat and make sure to not waste any food and consume healthier plant-based food. I found it interesting that people who live in cities contribute less to the climate crisis and use less greenhouse gases. More efficient houses are being built to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and utilize space in certain areas. I thought it was a little extreme when Ken started talking about only having up to 2 kids. This is something that would probably be beneficial to helping our climate crisis, but I don't see it ever becoming a strict rule in society. We should try these techniques to reducing carbon footprints and see if we can observe positive results. If so, we can continue to do this or we can change our techniques but the time for change starts now. Our generation is the one to make a difference.


<br><hr>
I definitely can relate to you when it comes to incautiously making decisions that are bad for the environment but like you am rethinking my carbon footprint. When it comes to transportation I have used a bike as my main form of getting around. Riding a bike is such a fulfilling experience as it is great exercise as well as significantly decrease your carbon emissions. As for the second point, I think you are right about it seeming infeasible, however, remaining at home with your parents is an eco-friendly option as you take up less land as a family unit than you would as a single tenant. Personally, I grew up on a ten-acre with its own water well as well as a garden which allowed my family to be self-sustaining when to come to our most basic needs. Now when it comes to food waste I can say I am as guilty as you. However, since taking this class I have now eliminated beef from my diet and can say chicken is an excellent supplement and have had absolutely no trouble making the switch. Doing something as small as this can decrease your carbon footprint from food by 80%. As for the fourth option, I disagree this will be a challenge, with the way automation is going many of our jobs will be replaced by robots so having fewer children will not only help the climate crisis but also provide more opportunity for the next generation with fewer candidates applying for the jobs that remain. As for the last point I 100% agree with the professor when he says many of us are becoming tired of our consumer culture and especially the fast fashion industry. With all the products currently out there from furniture, clothing to homes the second-hand market is the biggest it has ever been. These five ways of reducing your carbon footprint make me very hopeful as all these points are not too much to ask of my generation.
<br><hr>
I agree with and can relate to a lot of points that you made. Regarding the first method Ken mentions to reduce climate change–taking public transportation or riding a bike instead of driving–also made me grateful for the current situation I’m in now. I’ve always been a little upset that I don’t have a car up at school like so many of my friends do, but now I can view this situation that I once found annoying as one that’s actually helping out our planet, which is pretty cool. I also agree with your views of the second approach being infeasible for people who are already settled. I do think though that it is something that those of us who have not yet entered the workforce should really consider because there is an opportunity there to break the status quo and settle in an area with more eco-friendly housing and transportation options versus a suburb where you need a personal vehicle to efficiently move from place to place. As for the third suggestion made, I personally think I have already become much more conscious about my food waste and my consumption of meat. I have not committed to a fully plant-based diet yet, nor do I think I ever will, but I do choose white meat much more often than red meat nowadays, and consume less meat in general. I don’t know if I’ll ever go fully plant based just because of my heritage and how significant certain dishes which include meat are to my family. For the fourth approach, I guess I’ll see what happens when I get to that point in my life, but I will definitely be conscious of the environment when I plan on starting my own family. Finally, the fifth approach, that is definitely a hard habit to curb for me. I don’t have a problem buying used clothes, in fact most of my clothes are, but my amazon purchases are kind of ridiculous. Going forward I’m going to try and be more conscious about the amount of stuff I am purchasing and whether or not I really need certain items. I think as I’ve grown older and become more conscious of bills I already have developed more of an awareness for the amount of products I’m purchasing, and the necessity of them, but there’s always room for more improvement.
<br><hr>
After watching kens lecture, I believe this generation will not be able to do what previous generations failed to do: being environmentally conscious. I agree with you, ken gives us valid points on how to prevent and reduce our carbon footprint but the actions of a single individual will not be enough to reverse the damage made by previous generations. The human race is advancing and constantly evolving. With that in mind, people could care less about  being environmentally conscious because they would rather keep up with the latest trends rather than see the bigger picture of what those trends are causing to add on to the degradation of the planet. I already do most of the things out of the 5 ways ken mentions to lower our carbon footprint but then again, it is still asking too much for the selfish, general population. Seeing people disregard the environment as quick as they do discourages me to continuing doing what I am doing to lower my carbon footprint. We would ALL have to collectively change our ways in order to fix what previous generations have done.
<br><hr>
I hope your current prediction is correct, but there is a sharp difference between wanting action and taking action. I hope our generation can actually TAKE action.

From listing the five recommendations of living more sustainably, I'm not only more motivated to cut down my carbon footprint, but to also identify ways I'm already cutting down my footprint (even if they aren't intentional). Firstly living in Isla Vista basically eliminates the need for a car, as my biking is my primary mode of transportation. This seems to be the case of most students here as well: in fact, about 70% of UCSB students claim that this is their main method of transportation as well. The housing in Isla Vista also seems to be relatively sustainable, as well. Most properties tend to have at least six people living in them, which lowers the overall per capita footprint in terms of housing sources.
<br><br>

The generational divide between the responses to these suggestions may seem stark and polarized, but this difference was inevitable. On one hand, you have a generation that is trying to make their world a better place, even if it comes at the expense of living comfortably. On the other hand, you get a generation that caused this mess in the first place, and is unwilling to sacrifice their convenient lifestyles to save the lives of future generations. They are bound to respond like this most of the time: after all, why would they want to give away everything they've worked for?

<br><br>

This selfishness is a large part of why more hasn't been done regarding this climate crisis. If everyone were to come together and at least take up a few of the recommendations listed in this video, then the overall average footprint would drop dramatically (not to mention that if more people did it, lifestyles would not have to be changed as drastically per person). The best we can do to compensate for this greed is to get more involved and do as much as we can on this individual level, so we can rest knowing that we did all we did to help a dying planet.

I'd like to add that while reading your comment and watching Ken's lecture, I too like to acknowledge how we as UCSB students can already say that we for the most part can tackle 2 of the 5 suggested actions. As I looked at the other actions, the plant based diet one led me to think of my childhood and how I grew up. Growing up in a family of 6 where we all had to be fed, my mom would often ask what we should make for dinner. The question would often be something like "Beef or chicken?" Now that I look back at this, I grew up in a household where having meat had to be part of the meal. I never realized how bad that is for our environment, and am glad that I have learned new information to change a lifestyle. Throughout the course Ken has mentioned consumerism, fast fashion, and McMansions a lot. Since learning about them, it only makes me think of how I watch Youtubers do their huge house tours. When I recently watched one, an idea that came to my mind was how unnecessarily huge the house was, and his bad that is for the environment. I definitely agree with you about how it comes down to selfishness and greed. We've been taught that the American Dream is working for his many things you could buy and "collect". You see so many celebrities with several cars and unnecessary junk. It really shows the type of society we have grown up in. Gen X and the Boomers have really set us up to believe that having so much stuff is necessary to be happy. That is simply not the case, especially when it is damaging the earth to have more cars and things. (Reply to Kyle Fitzsimmons)

In the video “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?”, Ken talks about the scale of the things we have in the USA. This is something that I think encompasses many of the issues in our society. Consumerism in America has led to a society that wants “everything”, but the Earth’s resources are not boundless. The idea that “bigger is better” is taking a toll on the Earth’s ecosystems. The large meal portions in the US contribute to much of the food waste Ken spoke of in his video. Also, the idea that a bigger house is preferable, is both unreasonable and harmful to the environment as it contributes heavily to habitat loss in the USA as urban sprawl swallows the countryside. Another big problem is the size of our cars, which contribute even more heavily to our fossil fuel consumption than small, smart cars. We have to stop growing bigger and start growing better.
<br><br>

In the video “What the Boomer generation knew about the climate crisis – and when we knew it”, the scope of the knowledge about climate change in the US over the past half century is outlined. The reality of the situation, as Ken describes it, is that Americans have known about the harmful effects of the fossil fuel and meat industries since the 70s. This is worrisome to me because what ensures that our knowledge about it today will truly provoke change? As Ken stated, “Knowledge is not power. For it to become power, we must act upon it.” I think many of the more hopeful of the older generations assume that we will make these changes, but I think that is not set in stone. I hope that we can make these changes needed to heal our Earth and societies, but in all honesty, it’s most definitely a daunting task, and one that will be hard to enact without the help of much if not most of the population.

A couple of weeks ago, a comment was displayed in class stating the concept of ‘moral laziness.’ By definition, it means that a person knows the moral decision, but chooses to avert it because 1) they are either too lazy 2) it seems too hard or 3) someone else will do it so they do not feel the need too. Upon being introduced to this concept, I felt that it described me to the T. I drive a car that takes $90 to fill up, I hate vegetables, and I online shop for fast fashion at least once a day. I thought my small decisions wouldn’t make a big impact because I am just one person (and an incredibly small one at that). Even after these last few weeks of taking this class, I still have the same exact mindset of, “I’m not going to make a difference. Everyone else is already doing it, so why should I?” My strictly carnivorous diet in part with my choice to spend all of my money on clothes I probably will never wear are decisions that are entirely my own, and frankly have no intent on changing them. What would me eating a steak and buying a couple crop tops online do?
<br><br>

As Ken stated the 5 solutions in this video, I began to sit here and rethink my decisions that I once thought were small, but soon found out that it was so much more than that.  I have always dreamed of having a big family, an even bigger house, and all of the clothes in the world. I shared the same mindset that most of the older generation felt–  if I worked for it, why couldn’t I spend my money on what I want and live my life according to my terms? Why do I have to think about other people for my future? I did not realize that I was incredibly self-centered until I took this class and understood how I’m failing the planet at only 18 years old. If these 5 simple changes could save the Earth, why isn’t everyone–including me– doing it? For something as ethical and straightforward, the cost of turning in your car for public transportation or eating all your food is not the same as the cost of our Earth. I sound so hypocritical typing this because I wouldn’t have even thought of implementing these changes if it wasn’t for this video. I drove my car everywhere back home and didn’t even come within 50ft of public transportation until I came here; I threw entire meals away; there are piles of clothes in my closet that still have tags on them from years ago; and I will do everything to avoid vegetables at all costs. After watching this video, it really made me think deeply about how my choices not only affect myself, but also the world around me. My decisions were centered on myself, and I didn’t realize that there are immense repercussions to actions that once seemed so small. This is not the American way of life– this is a society that only cares about themselves.

Watching the first lecture video, “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?” reminded me of a conversation I had with one of my good friends from home. I had gone back to Orange County this past weekend for a family event and our conversation over a coffee date turned into an argument over the climate crisis. He asked me about my classes and I began explaining this course; I began sharing all that I have learned so far and how it has changed my outlook on the subject. He immediately became defensive when I said that there are several things we can do to limit our carbon footprint. Just as Ken did in the video, I explained how transportation, housing, and consumption are some of the key points in this argument. His response was that the only way we can “fix”, yes he used air quotes, this problem is by reducing the global population. And he said this in almost a sarcastic tone. 
<br><br>

After watching this video I realized that he is right in the sense that our population growth is a contributing factor in our greenhouse gas emissions, but I was also reassured that there are ways to reduce it. As a student at UCSB, I can say I am taking several actions to reduce my carbon footprint: not using a car, switching to a plant-based diet, biking or walking everywhere, and consuming much less. Although, this video also made me concerned that we may not be able to fix what Ken believes his generation did. I agree that the majority of my generation is more likely to be okay with doing his “five things to reduce your carbon footprint”, but I also know that my generation is becoming increasingly materialistic and centered around consumption. With that in mind, as well as the doubt and reluctance that comes from this “boomer” generation, I am concerned for the future of the climate crisis.

I do genuinely believe that our generation can have a positive impact on climate change through and through. While we may not see the answer solved in our lifetimes, we undoubtedly can begin working towards the solution. Sure the previous generations may have created the devices that bear harm to our planet, but knowledge is only expanding as time goes on, and knowledge is the most powerful thing when it is actually being used. But there's only so much that we can do on an individual level. While I can cut back on certain foods, manage waste more efficiently, or use public transportation, how does that compare to corporations bulldozing forests or drilling into the Earth itself for crude oil for the sake of capital gain? Everyone should do better, but am I to be held to a higher standard than Jeff Bezos for example, someone who can single-handedly improve the entire planet's well-being with a share of his wealth? Change must come through law and policy. One might say that it's up to us to acquire positions of power, but how long would that take when action must be taken now? But still a small difference is a difference nonetheless. Maybe a bottom-up effect can be the facilitator of change where the masses simply force change through their actions.

I am excited that we are getting into the climate change solutions. To halt the end of the world, I feel like those five tasks aren't too tall. 
<br><br>

Living in a large house is a luxury we can no longer afford. American's have created this romanticized dream where everyone's ultimate goal is to have a bathroom big enough to play basketball in. We don't need all this unnecessary space. We can live happier without killing the enviornment in a small area.
<br><br>

Like living spaces, transportation is also romanticized. Everyone wants the newest shiniest sports cars. SUV's and giant vans have become too common. These gas guzzling vehicles contribute to 25% of out emissions and can be solved with public transport and gas-efficient vehicles. One of the first problems we have to solve is normalizing public transit and getting the most out of it as possible/ Seeing public transport as poor and dirty will not help us reach our goal. 
<br><br>

Eating meat, also a highly romanticized meal in the US is a problem that contributes 15% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. We need to look to alternative sources that can provide us with healthier, more ethically sourced food that won't harm the environment. 
<br><br>

The older generations complain that taking away this lifestyle goes against the American don't realize that their children won't even have the option.




</p><hr>


<p>
I like the idea of an entire generation changing their lifestyle to become friendlier for the environment. However, it is quite hard to do that for the entire American society much more for the entire globe full of people with differing cultures and lifestyles. I guess this is the only way that one can have a more personal affect to climate change by making small lifestyle changes, but it becomes a bit discouraging when the rest of the world doesn’t follow the same changes. America I so caught up in the American dream which is depicted as being wealthy and living in a cookie cutter house with many materialistic needs. I feel like in order for there to be real change we have to change that notion that our success is defined by what we own and where we live. We should fix up the perspective do that our success is not based on our materialistic needs, but it is based on what we do for the planet. If we disregard our materialistic needs, it becomes easier for society to change their lifestyle choices. 
<br><br>

While I think these lifestyle changes will have some impact on the climate crisis, there has to be more done. Maybe there’s another way for us to have all of our materialistic needs but still become more environmentally friendlier. We have to look for other alternatives and innovations that go based of the natural laws of nature. I read an article of a scientist who developed a plastic made out of fish scales which decomposes easily. Maybe if we treated our processes in the same sense that nature is a balance, there could be other alternatives that giving up our materialistic needs. The reason I say this is because humanity is a very selfish species and this so the rest of those who don’t want to change their lifestyle will still continue to harm the planet and everyone within it.

In the lecture video, “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do” Ken finally gave me what I wanted and that was answers. These past weeks have been repetitive on the reasons why climate change is occurring and that the older generations are to blame. He gave us five things people can do in order to reduce their carbon footprint. They sound easy; however, many people are not willing to give up luxury cars, houses and many do not want small families. Are the older generations letting go of luxury cars and big houses? Do they eat mostly plant based foods? After all the older people are to blame it would be sad if the majority of the older generations are not willing to let go of some materialistic things. I do not believe that all the weight should be left on the new generation. We need help and we need it now.



</p><hr>


<p>

When stripped down to its essentials, the things we need to do as individuals to reduce our carbon footprint and care for the planet really don’t seem like a huge sacrifice, if one at all. The hardest change for society to make would be transitioning to a plant-based diet, but it’s a necessary one - the meat industry has indoctrinated the public into believing that meat is the only viable source of protein, but there are many other healthier and more sustainable options. Even consuming less beef and switching to poultry or seafood instead would make a difference. The other lifestyle changes we can make are very achievable and are even becoming the norm for younger generations. One of the positive changes our generation has done in reducing our carbon footprint is transitioning to renewable fashion - such as upcycling clothing and shopping from thrift stores - rather than purchasing from the unethical and unsustainable fast fashion industry. Many college graduates and young professionals also tend to move closer to cities for job opportunities, and cities are very conducive to leading more sustainable lifestyles as they usually have more efficient public transportation systems and more compact housing. Many cities - because they are usually more progressive and supportive of environmentally friendly causes than rural areas - also implement greener initiatives to reduce their impact on the earth. I used to live near Portland, OR and can attest to the greener and more sustainable way the city operates. Biking is much more popular and safer there than in places like L.A., where a car is usually needed because of urban sprawl and an inadequate public transit system. Many people there also lead plant-based diets, and there are community gardens scattered throughout the city where people can grow their own food. The quality of life is also great in Portland; because the city is cleaner than most others in America and full of green spaces, the people there are generally happier. 
<br><br>
It is frustrating that the mindset of the older generations is that “I’ve worked hard for what I have, so I should be allowed to engage in whatever consumerist practices that I want to despite it destroying the planet”. Driving gas-guzzling SUVs, living in huge suburban homes that produce enough gas, water, and electricity for ten people while only providing for four, and buying 60 new pieces of clothing each year are luxuries that we cannot afford. Even if we have the money for it, these unethical purchases are made at the expense of our planet. Material goods will have no meaning if the earth we live on is uninhabitable.

The world has known about climate change since before most of us in this class were even born. Lyndon B. Johnson gave his warning on the climate crisis and rising CO2 levels half a century ago, yet it came to no avail. When I try to think of what our government is doing to help the climate crisis I have no idea. I believe that is partly from my own laziness to consult the news media, but it is also because it doesn’t seem like those with the information have done much to notify the world. So many people are still unaware of the facts and effects of our presence on this earth and it saddens me when I must be the one to tell them what’s going on. It is hard to convince so many people to change the way they live, and when not everyone is on board, why should I even try? How can one person truly affect the grand scale of the climate crisis? As much as we want to help, it’s extremely difficult to give up the things we need to make life more convenient or efficient. Ken strongly emphasized the idea that “knowledge, if not acted upon, is power squandered.” Like our intentions and thoughts, our knowledge is only worth what we use it for. We must all act together. I want to try the 5 things to reduce my footprint, but I realistically know I won’t follow through for the rest of my life. However, I will certainly try to let others know how they can reduce theirs. I think the best my generation can do is to learn from history and start small if we want to accomplish anything.

I often grapple with the challenge of how we are going to get people in our generation to do something meaningful and try to reduce our green house gas emissions. It is awesome to be here at UCSB where there is a growing movement of like minded individuals who are actively seeking ways to reduce their carbon footprint. As great as it is to be in this community, there is still a large population of people who either don''t know the impact they're are having or choose not to do anything. It is true that we can have a profound difference on the health of our planet by making changes, yet the challenge lies in inspiring others to act in unison.  I like to e optimistic and think that those who don.t act to make a difference simply don't know the impact that they can have. I think the most important thing we can do as a generation besides reducing our own carbon footprints is to create a counter carbon culture that goes against the way that we raised and the type of economy that we grew up in. In addition, it is our responsibility to change the minds of our parents and relatives and inspire them to make positive changes in their lives as well as to raise the next generation of responsible and environmentally educated children.

This talk was especially intriguing to me since I feel as though more often than not we learn and read about how unfortunate we are as opposed to what we can do for improvement. I think this is both useful and significant in light of the fact that in any event a couple of these recommendations will resound with individuals and they will think about it. It additionally worked superbly of noting the talk's title, which when suggested as a conversation starter, is compelling in pulling the peruser in and driving them to the appropriate response.



</p><hr>


<p>
I loved this video for the reason that I really appreciate how Ken has simply outlined solutions people can act on. I know many people aren't quite sure where to start. As a student, a car sounds like a dream, but it is unnecessary. I have the option of walking, biking, and public transit, and they're all viable for the majority of the places I'd like to get to. Another thing Ken mentioned was having less children. Growing up I was completely sure I wanted to have children but as of last few years, I am not so sure anymore. The idea of having children in the current state the Earth is in, it doesn't seem realistic to have children and this is a sentiment I know a lot of people share. 

<br><br>

Food waste is a huge problem. Around the world, there are people dying of malnutrition and starvation, yet the United States wastes billions of dollars worth of food every year. Even on campus, I've heard from friends who work at the dining commons that a majority of the food is thrown out at the end of the day. This is infuriating to me because I have seen countless times students skipping meals because they are out of swipes or can't afford more. Why is food wasted instead of given to those who can't afford it? 
<br><br>

There's lot of stigma around thrifting; many people think the clothes are dirty, "too" used, and time consuming. However, my generation has started to thrift more and it has even started to become trendy to do so. I also used to believe that thrifting was weird or wasn't worth sorting through the racks. But it's crazy how easily people can be convinced to do things when they are considered cool or trendy. I am all for this trend of thrifting because it will definitely make a difference. Fast fashion is a huge issue and is a contributing factor is the climate crisis. I absolutely love thrifting and although you don't always leave the store with clothes, you are making a difference by choosing to thrift. 
<br><br>


The solutions Ken has offered seem like they wouldn't do much, but if an entire generation can practice even some of these habits, we could make a great change. They are all certainly doable, especially as college students. We live on a campus where biking, walking, and public transportation are the most common ways of transportation. Sure a car would be great; something to call your own and drive greater distances without the wait times of the bus, but ultimately, it isn't necessary. It is a luxury that we are convinced we deserve. Thrifting is also much more cost efficient and as college students, I know a majority of us wouldn't mind saving a few extra dollars to use on other necessities, like groceries and housing. A majority of us already do shared housing and live with roommates in smaller spaces. We are all capable of making a difference and it's up to us to motivate ourselves and to teach others these habits and lifestyles.

I really like this lecture in that it is a straightforward, simple approach that can be done on an individual scale, which does not at all sound too daunting to attempt. 
<br><br>

Of all the points made in this video, I find the idea of rethinking of the things that you own resonate with me the most. Growing up, my family wasn't exactly well off, and so I would spend Monday mornings with my mom sometimes going to these secondhand clothing store that are almost like goodwill outlets but smaller, where my mom would be sitting for hours on end digging through trash bags full of clothes, and I would get so bored and almost repulsed, but that was the only way we were getting new clothes. And so ever since we began being able to afford new clothing, I never understood the logic or see the appeal in buying preowned items again, and so I can understand why the older generations would find it difficult to have to live this seemingly frugal and unfair lifestyle when they've worked so hard for their money.
<br><br>

However, as long as it took, I was able to finally wrap my head around the fact that not only is thrifting more economical, it is absolutely necessary. Despite what companies like H&M might try to convince you with their "conscious" clothing lines, they are not and will never be sustainable, with the way their business model words, constantly pumping out 50 designs per week and influencing the consumer on a subconscious level that they need new stuff to stay trendy. At this rate, we can not afford to keep dumping out tons of polyester every year onto landfills; out planet can not simply handle it. It is really encouraging for me to see that thrifting has become the trendy thing among young people; not only do I find that there is not shame in buying preowned clothing (nor is it a punishment) there is also a certain joy in finding clothing items that you like at a good price, so you can spend your money in other meaningful experiences in your life.

I believe that these two lectures were very thought-provoking. In fact, they are now my favorite lectures so far. I really enjoyed the quote “If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered." It goes to show that it does not matter if someone has all the knowledge in the world; the universe will not change if that person does not act upon that knowledge. We know that we have a climate crisis that will lead to the end of humanity if we do not change our actions. According to the lecture, we have known about it for a while now. However, climate change continues to be a major problem. I find it very disappointing that the generation before knew about the issue, but decided not to do much about it, especially the people who are currently in power in our nation. As a result, it is now my generation’s job to try and reverse the everything. I did not expect the severity regarding the climate crisis before I took this class. However, I do want to be part of the solution, not the problem. 
<br><br>

The list presented in the lecture for lowering my carbon footprint was more simple than I expected. I am happy to say that I have already implemented some of the actions in my daily life. Regarding transportation, I am fortunate enough to live in a community in Santa Barbara where it is easier to make better transportation decisions; there is a decent public transportation system and a huge biking culture here. In addition, I live in an apartment with five other people. However, I am also guilty of continuing other actions that is hurting our planet, such as eating meat and buy more stuff than I actually need. After obtaining the knowledge that these are hurting the planet, I am trying to cut my meat consumption down and not impulsively purchase items that I do not actually need.

Ken’s video was actually my favorite since the beginning of this course. I know he said in lectures that in future weeks we would be diving into more positive subjects regarding climate change, but this was the first, so far, that has done just that. The five lifestyle changes Ken went over really helped put my effect on the world in perspective. Transportation, Housing, food consumption, population, and consumerism, many of these things I currently have control over, and that gives me hope that I can make the changes he mentioned in his video. 

<br><br>

Recently, for my ES class, I had to take the online Carbon Footprint Calculator Quiz to determine my personal carbon footprint and how many Earths would be needed to sustain life if everyone lived like me. According to that website, I would need 1.9 Earths to sustain my lifestyle, which sadly did not come as a shock to me. However, it is quite worrisome considering my lifestyle includes walking/ carpooling, co-housing, relatively small consumption of goods, and a moderate consumption of meats. This honestly does not seem like a terribly impactful lifestyle, yet, it would still take nearly two Earths to sustain and the hardest reality to face is that we only have one.

I also appreciate the switch to positivity and solutions, though I am wondering whether one might feel discouraged after finding out that they already do the 5 things. If one thinks "That's it?" maybe they would feel bad that the world is still perishing as they're doing their part. They might feel cheated that other people are not equally pulling their weight (and some are especially dragging the rest of us down). I guess this is similar to the comment from the film Before the Flood, as well (in which a representative from India mentions how America is one of the key players in causing climate change but not doing nearly enough to combat CO2 emissions, while other countries are doing their best with what they have).
<br><hr>
I mostly understand where you’re coming from when you said that some might feel disheartened knowing they are pulling their weight while others are not, but I would have to disagree. I am currently doing all five of Ken’s solutions to the best of my ability, yet I still feel the overwhelming responsibility to do even more. As Ken referenced in his video, these five things would drastically reduce anyone’s carbon footprint by at least half of its size, but this is not meant to be the only solution to our problems. Others may also find things like transportation unavoidable due to the demands of their job or something similar. However in a case like that, the person commuting hours to work could also be the same person that is a leading climate scientist working to solve the world’s many problems. In this sense, everyone has a different approach to solving the climate crisis. I do not think any concerned individual would simply say “that’s it”, but rather they should ask “what can I do next”.
<br><hr>
I am also glad that Prof. Ken finally gave us some tools in changing our lifestyles for the better so that we can help in stopping the climate crisis. I want to being changing my lifestyle to be more environmentally conscious begging with eating less meat. These 5 things are so simple and I wish they could be shared with a larger audience so that everyone could begin doing it. Sadly, as the video showed, most people of older generations have trouble changing their ways and can sometimes even get offended by the advice to change their lifestyles. This type of mindset is the reason why we are headed in the direction we are going.

I also felt partially relieved knowing that I have a small portion of control and influence on climate change, and if we act accordingly as a population, these changes can have massive impacts. I find it interesting that each individual action has a corresponding government action (ex. Housing choices of individuals can lead to changed urban planning and zoning by city planners, or increased usage of bikes can result in better bike lanes). This is a great example, in my opinion, of how the personal is political. Each action we take has a larger impact, and can either serve to close the generational gap between the (generally) more environmental and minimalist youth, and the consumerist previous generation who now holds political control. Our individual actions on these small day-to-day levels and reduction of our own carbon footprints can be echoed in the policies and practices our political leaders implement. 
<br><br>

However, posing the generational gap so starkly also makes me apprehensive about the future. If the older generation (now in control politically) is so against many of these lifestyle changes, then how can we push towards not just a change in smaller actions, but a complete cultural, lifestyle, and mindset shift in Ken's generation as a whole? I think after changing our own actions, answering this question is a key step for positive progress in environmental rehabilitation.
<br><hr>
This was also my favorite video so far in this class. The five lifestyle changes that Ken pointed out were all things that I can try to do now and in the future. At the moment, I can work on reducing my meat consumption and my consumption of goods like clothing. The point you made about your personal carbon footprint corresponding to how many Earths would be needed to sustain life really put my consumption into perspective for me. I think I consume goods at an average or slightly higher than average rate, and so the number of Earths needed to sustain my lifestyle would probably be slightly higher than yours. This is an alarming fact to me and makes me want to really start cutting down on my consumption immediately. My goal would be to work on these five lifestyle changes and cut my current climate footprint in half.

One generation certainly can try to fix what previous generations failed to, and that prospect alone should be enough. As outlined in this video, there are multiple ways in which humans need to adapt in order to ensure there is a planet to adapt to, lest we be destroyed by climate change. Increases in public transportation, downsizing on houses, and a transition away from fast fashion may seem like drastic changes, but the alternative is literal destruction. It’s scary to think that people would rather deny the problem and continue their lives ignorant to a problem that threatens our very existence. It isn’t a question of whether or not we can make a change to preserve our future, because we have the ability to do so. However at this point, we may already be too far gone. The next few years are going to determine whether we live or die as a species, and I’m not sure the US is in a place politically or socially to tackle this issue because so many would rather hold tight to the comfortability of the present, where the ever warming climate isn’t as intrusive.

It's interesting to me that political activism is left out of the picture here. Five options on what we can do, five personal changes... but nothing really collective, no? Nothing that involves banding together in solidarity, fighting for what's right with others and attempting to make systematic change. Because, really, I think that's what's being left out here. While yes, it's extremely important to make these personal choices-- we do need to give up fast fashion and meat and suburbia and cars-- it is vastly difficult to do so right now. It is essentially impossible, in 80+% of America, to live without a car. We simply don't have the public transportation capacity to do it; our roads lack sidewalks and bike paths, our cities are not nearly dense enough. Hell, California is essentially allergic to building more than two floors in one house. The same can be said for meat, where meat options are easier and/or cheaper than vegetarian a vast percentage of the time, and things like premade and prespiced tofu or seitan are incredibly hard to get one's hands on. None of these things are impossible... but they really are if we only make individual action. They are if we ignore collective change. 
<br><br>

Instead of focusing solely on individual decisions, I really do hope this class speaks more about collective action. It's only through political action that we will ever change how our cities are planned or what our supermarkets look like. No amount of individual consumer action is enough, and it simply requires far more than that.

Ever since taking this class, I’ve been more aware of the little things that can help decrease my carbon footprint. It’s encouraging, but sometimes I still feel like one person compared to a whole country and all of these politicians with power. At the same time, I think other people might feel that way too, maybe thinking, “I’m just one person. Eating meat, buying new clothes, and driving a car won’t hurt.” It’s a mindset that’s hard but necessary to get rid of, switching to believing that we all can greatly reduce our carbon footprint and do our part to slow climate change. Of all the five things we can do, the housing aspect was honestly a bit of a surprise to me. I know about alternatives to everything else, like public transportation or biking or going to a thrift store and such, but I never considered the apartment alternative until now. Maybe it’s because it’s so ingrained from the previous generation to us as children that as we’re older, we grow up and buy a house in the American way. A house really does sound nicer than an apartment or shared living, but it’s sacrifices we have to make if we want to actually step up and do something. It’s disappointing that Ken’s generation failed to act when they had the information on their laps but there’s nothing we could do about the past, the only option is to act now and educate so that it’s clear that this is a matter that affects everyone regardless of whatever political party that they are a part of.

Even though it may feel like it, you are not alone when taking small steps to decrease your carbon footprint. Just from the start of this quarter, many of my classmates enrolled in English 23 and Environmental Studies courses have already taken action such as reducing or removing meat from their diet or attempting to use less energy and gas. Many of my friends have said that learning in class about the climate crisis and generalized consequences of things such as meat production was the impetus for their lifestyle change. Observing how so many people are taking real action, even when it requires giving things up, is inspiring. Just like other comments have talked about how this lecture was more optimistic and positive, seeing people taking action into their own hands is what makes me agree with Ken and others that our generation has a chance to solve this crisis. 
<br><br>
I think one major generation difference that has allowed our generation to embrace this issue is that we have learned about climate change in school and heard about it on the news from a young age. Even though it may not be the same in all areas, my school consistently discussed environmental problems and made me conscious of things such as energy use from a very young age. Even though the science was there in the times of previous generations, it was not as widely accepted and certainly not as taught in schools. Because our generation has been exposed to it so extensively, it has allowed for us to understand the severity of the issue and care about the issue enough to commit to changing our own lives and fighting for political change. I also think that it is harder to make people accept climate change at an older age and that it is easier to get young people to accept the science and recognize that addressing the problem may require sacrifices.

This lecture is probably one of my favorites so far. It was both informative and optimistic. We are 4 percent of the global population but have produced 25% of its CO2. This statistic alone tells a story, it says it's time to make a change. Ken described 5 different ways we as Americans can significantly decrease our carbon footprint. He mentioned transportation, housing, food, children, and overall rethinking our relationship to stuff. I feel that changing the way we as a new generation thinks about stuff is the most important of all. We are of a culture where owning the nicest house, fastest car, and the most fashionable clothes define our worth. It really doesn’t need to though. You can be successful and still live a modest environmentally friendly life. Stuff doesn’t replace genuine human connection. Unfortunately, much of the older generation doesn’t see it that way. Even though the boomer generation is largely passive on the problem, the more we do to show we are actively attempting to make a change, the more pressure it puts on them to do the same. I for one, am convinced that it is time to start cutting meat out of my diet. Each lecture I’ve been to and the more of the homework I do, the more I feel that's the biggest thing I can do to make a change. Honestly, I really do believe that activism and making this the most relevant, unavoidable issue we can make will convince people in denial of the seriousness to change. I see a tough but bright future for humans, but we have to act now.

During the first two weeks of this class, this course was very depressing and it seemed like humans have already done the irreversible. But now that the course is picking up, Kenneth kept his promise that this course will be taking a more optimistic light. I appreciate that Kenneth has taken his time to present us with ways where we can minimize our carbon footprint. 
<br><br>

He mentions that trading in our automobiles for mass transit, a bike, or walking will do the planet a huge favor. But I feel as if that isn’t possible for everyone. As a car owner myself and living in Los Angeles, I heavily rely on my car to go from one place to another. I think that car manufacturers should focus on making every new car more eco-friendly than the last. Not everyone wants to move into the city, it’s cramped, expensive, and not everyone’s cup of tea. I absolutely agree with Kenneth’s suggestion of eating less meat. We don’t have to completely omit meat from our diets, but just simply eating less will definitely benefit our planet. After watching the documentary Cowspiracy, I myself have already cut back on eating meat. There’s so many other substitutes to meat and converting to a plant- based diet is so much healthier for our bodies and the planet. 
<br><br>

I feel guilty saying that I know that I buy way too much clothes. Half of the things in my closet are things that I don’t even wear. I definitely need to take Hiltner’s advice of just buying less because there’s no reason why a person needs so many different articles of clothing. I am not surprised that 25% of all greenhouse gases put into the atmosphere are put there by americans. Americans are materialistic, we love big houses, abundant clothing, and fancy cars. None of these suggestions are hard to do, we just all have to collectively change our lifestyles. I am not surprised that my generation has given these lifestyle change suggestions positive consideration. And I now understand why Kenneth’s generation is so reluctant to transition to a more eco-friendly lifestyle. But we cannot afford to be reluctant, the climate crisis is happening right now and it is all our responsibility to mitigate it.

I believe we need to stop accusing the old generations and begin to focus on what we can do as an individual and how we can influence and educate the newer generations to make a change. The people who refuse to believe that humans are directly harming the environment will refuse to make changes in their lifestyles which will lead to no future change. Deniers will be deniers and wasting our time trying to convince them to get on board is useless. It is extremely hard to have each and every single individual on the same boat so instead us, believers, should focus on ourselves and the change we can contribute. Professor Ken Hiltner offers us a variety of methods that can ultimately help save the planet, such as using a different method of transportation, changing our consumer demands, moving to a city and residing at a small eco-household, switching to a plant-based diet, and minimizing population by having less children. I believe there is more believers than deniers so if we all come together and make a change than we can have a great impact on fossil fuel companies and new regulations that need to take place. Through education, we will be able to change attitude and behaviors of the youth. Eventually, more individuals will take responsibility for our own actions. I appreciate Professor Hiltner’s passion and determined mindset. He truly is educating and training individuals to be problem solvers and have enabled us to truly grasp the true harms and dangers of climate change in order for us to be motivated to make a change.

I thoroughly enjoyed this lecture. Unlike the previous couple of reading and movie assignments, this lecture left me with a much more positive and hopeful attitude. Through this video, Ken shows us that it is in our reach to be able to make a change, and lucky enough for me, these 5 options aren't too difficult to manage. It's all about compromise in my opinion, you don't have to go completely plant-based- just try simply cutting meat out a couple times a week until it's not that hard anymore. Make your best effort not to shop at fast fashion retailers etc. Saving the earth, or what we can do rather, is not as difficult as it seems. 
<br><br>


One thing that has always struck a chord with me is fast fashion. The fashion industry is one of major destruction in terms of the planet. Something I find super admirable are companies like Reformation- clothing brands that use 100% sustainable materials and ethical labor. Although they might be pricier, the brands are setting the tone for the rest of the industry. Since the introduction of sustainable fashion, so many brands have been making an effort to lessen their impact on the climate and I personally think that's amazing.

This lecture brings to light the different things that we are able to do in the present to slow down climate change. Points that stood out to me would be the reception to these proposed ideas. I like how it delves into the reactions of everyday people as opposed to large companies or climate change deniers. In addition to the mention groups of people, there is an additional problem; oftentimes people do not want to change their way of living despite understanding and supporting climate change activism. People are just oftentimes not motivated to change their habits if it involves a harder way of living or a less enjoyable one. The problem with this is that most people will not really change unless they or their families are directly impacted by climate change in a devastating manner. Unfortunately, by the time mos people come to this realization by being personally affected, it would have already been too late.
<br><br>

The younger generation is not without blame either. Industries such as fast fashion and livestock farming thrive because of the amount of money people are willing to put in it. We as the younger generation are quick to blame the boomers or people from foreign countries, not recognizing that we are just as bad; in fact, we are worse as we have the means and resources to impact climate change in a positive way while some people don't, yet the US has not stepped up to the plate.

The five steps Ken proposed really resonated with me and made me reflect on my personal lifestyle choices. These steps are not asking too much of people and should therefore be fairly easy to implement into our everyday lives, but there is one problem. The lush lifestyles Americans have asscustoed themselves to living in does not fit any of these parameters. Since the beginning of our nation, “The American Dream” has been to own a great big house and have a big happy family. Sadly, these ideals do not support mitigating our climate crisis. A large societal shift needs to occur if we want to make a difference, and for many people that is going to be very hard. The average American is accustomed to driving their personal vehicles wherever they please and buying new clothes every month. As a nation, we must begin to make small changes to stop our consumerism lifestyles or we will not have a planet to live on. 
<br><br>

Ken mentioned that moving to cities and utilizing public transportation would drastically eliminate our carbon footprint. This idea seems very simple when I first heard it, but as I reflected on my hometown I realized that it is not always feasible. I grew up in a very rural area in Northern California. My town has about 12,000 residents and we do have a bus system. However, this bus system is often unreliable and not always filled with the individuals I feel comfortable riding with alone. Therefore I drive everywhere, because it is a faster and safer option for me. I believe this might be a similar issue for many rural towns in california, because the bus systems are not in as high of a demand as they are in big cities.

Before watching this video, I always have questions about what we can do right now since human actions brought about the climate crisis more severe than before. Professor give us 5 devices: transportation, housing, waste less food and eat a largely plant-based diet, have less child, and buy necessary stuff. I agree with these advices that the professor gives to us, but I think sometimes it is challenging. Nowadays, people have the ability to buy more cars. In China, even the government using policies like restricting the last license plate number every day, but a lot of people buy more cars to avoid the inconvenience. In my generation, I think we already change the way to use transportation. Some people from the last generation like driving, but in my generation, I think we are willing to take the bus or the railway, sometimes ride the bicycle. About waste less food and eat a largely plant-based diet, I was surprised that, yet we waste between 1/3 to 1/2 of the food that we produce. I think sometimes the extra food can be taken away. Although reduce waste is challenging, we still need to take action to achieve. I hope that we can all take action to protect the environment.

I agree with your suggestions on reducing individual impacts on the climate, and I believe that we're in an advantageous position today where these lifestyle changes are celebrated by the community whereas decades ago there may have been a negative stigma about living your life with some of these sacrifices. In the video “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?" Ken mentions many things that I find myself responsible for and I think the first step is realizing how you're messing up before you can start correcting your behavior.
<br><br>

Although one may not find the fact that it is on regular people to fix the climate (as opposed to the big companies who are largely responsible) we need to do our best regardless because we are past the point of waiting around for others to do the right thing. However, in order to do this effectively, we need to continue organizing social events promoting the changes in lifestyle that Ken mentioned in the video. As a community, we have been doing a good job in that aspect, but we cannot stop now.

I'm glad that Ken decided to make a video about what we can personally do to mitigate the consequences of the climate crisis. It's easy to sit here and shun the previous generations for giving us a crappy situation; it's much more effective, however, to make as much change in our own lives to help the environment. After all, don't we wanna be better than our predecessors, and learn from their mistakes?
<br><br>


It's hard making changes for the environment, but I assure other people in my generation that it feels satisfying to do so. After learning about how much humans have negative impact on the Earth in ENGL22, I felt guilty because of how I had been living my life before. I decided to go vegetarian last quarter (obviously not as effective as going straight vegan), and I honestly thought the transition was going to be super difficult because I just "couldn't go without meat." What I did learn, however, is that I literally can go without meat, and it's pretty easy. Going vegetarian was just one way that I wanted to mitigate my carbon footprint. I did a lot of reflecting during ENGL22 and I realized I am very materialistic, in the wrong way. I would constantly go shopping (even during Ken's class itself) and buy clothes because I wanted to feel trendy and better about myself by keeping in style. I've realized the errors of my way and have decided to primarily buy from thrift stores from now on (and it saves me a ton of money too.) Thankfully, our generation has made it trendy to go thrifting, and it feels super satisfying to buy something super cool for only $5.

I really enjoyed watching this lecture! I think it is in part because it starts to discuss what we can do as individuals to help, and take action in the climate crisis. I also found it very interesting to watch the typical responses Ken gets from our generation vs. his generation. I found these reactions to be very accurate when I was thinking about the conversations I have had with a few different people. For example, I have mentioned some of the small things we could do as individuals to my dad and he has always seemed uninterested. He is set in his ways as I assume many people are. I think Ken’s generation typically has reactions like this because they have already built a life. They have a big car, multiple kids, eat meat, a big house and many other luxuries that they have worked for so this is what they are used to and have built their life around it. Whereas the younger generations have not yet established this. This may be partly why I have more of an attitude and reaction of a person from younger generations. I would be good living in a smaller apartment, biking or walking to work, changing my diet, and not having more than two kids. All of these things seem very doable to me but maybe that's because I can still build my life around them. I can find a job in a city and avoid cars, ect. And do this all as I develop my life. This is why it is important for us to learn what we can do when we are young so we can take action early on and hopefully build our lives while being aware of the environment and the climate crisis.

<p>
One thing that struck me about Ken’s lecture was when he said that knowledge is only power if acted on. This is very true, although I had never thought about it that way before. It is so frustrating to think about all the things the past generations (not even just the Boomers, but the generation before as well) knew, and all the power they could have had -- the profound changes they could have made -- had they acted.
<br><br>

I also really appreciated Ken listing five things we could do to begin (or continue) our climate activism. As he went through the list, I tried to think about which things I do, and which things I need to work to be better at. The first being transportation; I do not own a car, and for the most part, I only really drive when I go with my house mates to the grocery store. This made me think about the community of Isla Vista/UCSB, and I think that is probably true for many people. Certainly more students don’t have cars than do, and many of us have little reason to campus/IV. Second being housing; nearly every student at this school lives with roommates/housemates. Third being the way we eat; this is something most people (including myself) still have to work on, but I know so many people who make a conscious effort to cut down on meat. The fourth thing: have no more than one child per person. This one is very interesting, especially when I think about how none of my friends want kids at all. For some of us it’s because of the environment, and for others it is because of careers and freedom. The last thing has to do with shopping. Most of my clothes are thrifted, but I still think this is probably my biggest weak spot. I bought a couple things from Forever 21 last week and I still feel guilty about it.
<br><br>

It was interesting to me to go through each solution and think about how myself and the community work on each thing. There’s still so far to go, and the issue is still daunting (and far from solved) but it gave me a little hope.

I must say, you described our community here at UCSB/IV very well. I believe that our community is unique and special since we live in California, we are young college students, and we aware of the climate crisis and the dangerous effects it is currently causing to our world and will continue to destruct our home if we do not act. Unfortunately, this is not what the rest of America believes or the lifestyles they choose to have. Too many people across the nation are ignorant on the choices they make every single day and are oblivious to how much of their daily life choices have a profound impact on their carbon footprint and our climate. 

<br><br>

I believe that the transportation solution would be a great way in having everyone across the nation begin their activism in fighting the climate crisis. This would not only greatly reduce carbon emissions but would also make commuting to places much more efficient and quicker since there would be less traffic. The housing option might be a little more difficult to obtain since rent prices in big cities are very expensive and not many can afford it. I believe moving to a plant based diet will not only be beneficial to our planet, but would also ensure that we all live long and healthy lives, which I believe is a great win-win situation. I do believe that it would be hard to cut back on our meat consumption but it is not impossible. Even if one were to eat meat only once or twice a week as opposed to every day, it will greatly help and we will be able to see noticeable changes!

This video has really made me think about the carbon footprint I’ve left in the short amount of time I’ve been alive. I’m sure I’m not the only one guilty of doing all the things Ken said not to do in the video but after becoming aware of these things I’ll try my best not to do them. I think out of the five options Ken gave to help reduce our carbon footprint not driving my car would be the hardest for me. It’s hard for me to think about always taking public transportation but that’s because I grew up in a small town with not many options of public transportation and personally I don’t prefer big city living but if it meant reducing the effects of climate change, I believe I can do what’s necessary to help reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that are causing our Earth’s destruction and I know I’ll be able to live without my car because I already do in Santa Barbara. I take the bus or bike every day to class and I’ve been fine so far so I know I could do it.
<br><br>
While making these changes might be difficult for some, it’s necessary to save our planet. These changes are not so drastic that they would destroy your life or even harm you at all. It might be inconvenient but the Earth is more important than getting new clothes or eating the hamburger. I hope my generation can be dedicated enough to help change their ways to save our Earth with these five solutions.

I totally agree with your statement, “While making these changes might be difficult for some, it’s necessary to save our planet. These changes are not so drastic that they would destroy your life or even harm you at all. It might be inconvenient but the Earth is more important than getting new clothes or eating the hamburger.” I think a major problem for our generation is that the Climate Crisis seems so daunting and urgent, we feel helpless and don’t know exactly what to do about it. I think this is the same issue past generations went through and what they chose to do was ultimately nothing. The opportunity we have now as educated, future and current voters is to raise awareness and vote for the right politicians. By making it known to the public that we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint by: reducing car use, household size, food waste, less meat and mass consumption. I am completely for these five lifestyle changes and believe this should be taken up by everyone, especially Americans. I believe I am particularly guilty of buying too much but I am actively fixing this flaw by buying thrifted clothes and used items. I tend to replace phones every three years and not every year as most people tend to do. I also no longer ask my parents for a trip to the shopping mall where we might be tempted to buy things we don’t actually need. I am really glad that minimal house design and lifestyle is popular because it forces us to consider quality over quantity and buy only the things we value and not the things we want. Like Profesor Hiltner said, the ideal older American generations cling on to of “eating what we want, buying what we want and having as many children as want” is outdated and no longer feasible in a planet with 7 billion+ people.
<BR><HR>

I've also found myself self-conscious about how big my carbon footprint is. Much like Ken said, the way we were brought up, the habits we developed surrounding housing, transportation, diet, and so forth, has genuinely been detrimental to the planet. It is up to us, the younger generation to make changes. in our lifestyles. As 4% of the global population, Americans create a proportionally larger carbon footprint compared to the rest of the world. 
<br><br>

What was brought up in lecture this week in relation to moral laziness makes me skeptical as to whether our generation truly has the conviction and discipline required to make these changes but I guess we will have to wait and see. Personally, I went vegetarian a year ago in response to the ethical treatment of animals as well as environmental concerns. The notion that locoing up meat would be hard because so many people enjoy eating it is an example of moral laziness. Just because something tastes good does not mean that it is good for you. If catholics can give up the things they love for Lent on religious grounds, the rest of the world can. surely give meat up for forty days for the sake of their very own existence. 
<br><br>

Consumerism in America is also a big concern. Of course, an environmentalist would support the reduction of consumerism, but many businesses would rather. discourage it on the basis of their need for revenue. The sad fact the matter is that the American economy is so heavily based on throwaway culture, fast fashion, and unnecessary spending in general. My mother. once told me that the hallmark of a good economy was a busy mall. The fixation with GDP and with the accumulation of possessions in American culture seems like a hurdle that will. be difficult for many to overcome, regardless of age. For example, take a look at our generation's obsessions with the latest smartphone models. Everyone wants the newest technology because it is a status symbol. At the end of the day, I believe the sooner or later a sense of urgency will be fostered in our generation that allows us to make a difference, however big or small the changes may be.

After watching this lecture video I was surprised to see that most of these things I already do and they are not as difficult as they seem. Just last summer I decided to go vegetarian and my diet changed drastically because I come from a family that would consume a lot of meat, and to my surprise, it was actually not as difficult as I thought it would be. After becoming a vegetarian, the rest of my family also decided to cut back on meat. I also am always aware of the way I get places and most places I try to use public transportation or walk. Another thing that I do is always try to recycle my clothes, by shopping at thrift stores and upcycling clothes that I already have if I get tired of them. After watching this and realizing that it is that simple I was a lot more hopeful for the future. At the beginning of this class, I was scared for the future of the earth, but with this video, I felt optimistic about the future. I hope more people watch this video and also take action into their own hands.

When I go out with my friends, we like to Uber . When we have people more than a car can fit, we even call for another. After watching this lecture, I genuinely feel that it’s my responsibility to save the earth, and in the future, I will definitely choose to take public transportation over Uber because of fact that cars emit enormous amount of greenhouse gas in to air.

After watching this video and the documentary,  I think the climate issues in the United States have upgraded to a political level. I think many Americans live a very environmentally efficient and green lifestyle due to my years of experience with American homestay families during my high school period here. But in order to fully implement the environmental-friendly policies, the government needs to act immediately. It is normal to see so many bicycles at UCSB, but outside of UCSB there are cars on the road. People have no choice. 

<br><br>

The state of California claimed to build up a modern high-speed train railway. But years after years, delays after delays, the final result is not a high-speed railway route--- is a cancellation. If the high-speed train were built, the numbers of people choose to drive will decrease and the high-speed train is much less pollutive to the environment. Now, people still stick to the old- fashioned way which is much less friendly to the environment way. 

<br><br>

The professor also mentions to move to a big city, so it is more convenient. It is possible in New York, Tokyo, Beijing, Paris, etc. Those cities have a well-established subway system and urban lifestyle culture.  Cities like this are rare in the United States. The nearest large city here in Los Angeles, but everyone in LA drives. Even though there is a subway system in LA, but it is limited for people to take it. It takes too long to wait and it stops are limited. And the LA county is big, so it pushes people to drive.

<br><br>

There is still a long way to go, and our generation knows more and experiences more. I believe that when we take control of the world that it will be a more beautiful planet.



</p><hr>


<p>

From the beginning of this course, I always question about what we can do right now. In America, there are a lot of people driving to everywhere. If we take public transportation or ride to work, it will reduce a lot of carbon footprint. Micro apartment could also decrease the footprint. Moving to the city could do both. For example, in New York City, there are more and more people to take public transportation and live in the micro apartment. Concerning more about what you eat like refusing waste food could also make contribution to the control of the climate crisis. Have less that one child per person. Rethink the relationship with stuff. They are related, to reduce consumption. With those suggestions, we should take actions now.

Many examples of lifestyle changes were made in the video, however, it is easier said than done.  Many want to make though changes to benefit the planet but struggle to because they have been living their life a completely different way all the time and to instantly make a switch like that will require a lot of will power.  Many are doing things like going vegan to help the planet and if you just think a few years back people were vegan but it was not talked about as much as it is today.  In the past when you heard someone was a vegan it was almost like a surprise to know they made that big change in their life but now when you hear that your friend or someone go vegan you're just like oh okay good for you because it is so common now.  Now a lot of restaurants are including vegan options and you didn’t really see that a couple of years ago.  Just last year a lot of fast-food chains have been adding new beyond and impossible meat to their menu.  I think to make a lifestyle change like that it is better to have family or friends around you making the change as well because then you guys can do it together.  I feel like more and more people are vegan because everyone is doing it and give new people its advice on how to start.  I think we can start other lifestyle changes but many people will struggle until they have a good majority of support with family and friends doing these lifestyle changes too.

I found this particular video extremely interesting because of the rather odd contrast I see in today's societies regarding these concepts. 1) I see many people attempting to drive teslas/electric cars, take mass transit, bike, etc. and that is great, however, at the same time SUV sales are at an all time high. On top of that we see many new apartment complexes being built in cities but at the same time new neighborhoods of typical suburban homes are also opening across the area. 2) Plant based diets are slowly being promoted as I see vegetarian based restaurants being opened up but at the same time I see many places that serve meat become all you can eat places and so worth. 3) Thrift store shopping has become a trend as of late but so has the world of fast fashion with brands such as H&M becoming widely popular in the last years leading to production of many cheap, disposable clothing. These 3 examples laid out here are what I have personally experienced/viewed in my hometown and I assume is accurate in many other parts of the US as well. I feel like there are many whom are trying to make the necessary steps but at the same time there are those that counteract all the good we attempt to do. In general, this fits the overall idea of the climate crisis as people are trying to solve the climate crisis and there are those politicians against the climate crisis. All in all, no matter how small or how large the impact is, every good people seem to do is counteracted with another bad from my experience.

Watching “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?,” made me so much more pleased with my decision to take this class. As much as I did want to know what the climate crisis really consisted of, how it’s happened, and how it’s getting worse, I took this class in hopes of discovering what I can do everyday to make a difference. I have felt that everyone discussing the climate crisis is too concerned with everyone else and their effect on the planet’s demise, when they should actually be focusing on their own impact. Watching your lecture, “What the Boomer generation knew about the climate crisis – and when we knew it,” talked about exactly this. Although this information is important in understanding the past and the people who have gotten us here, how useful is it to point fingers at this point? I believe that, yes, we should be trying to convince the boomer generation still acting in this destructive way to change, but shouldn’t we be focusing more on the upcoming generations? The time to better the Earth is now, and the generations growing up right now have the power to change this planet’s future. For instance, teaching kids in school about the five simple steps we can all take to reduce carbon emissions may provide the future generations with an environmentally friendly lifestyle from the get-go rather than forcing them to change their already harmful habits.

Your comment was an extremely interesting read. As I’m sure many other students have, I also chose to take this class because I wanted to learn more about what I could do to make a difference, big or small, regarding the climate crisis. I think activism is important but so are the small lifestyle changes that people often brush aside. I was particularly interested with you saying that “everyone discussing the climate crisis is too concerned with everyone else and their effect on the planet’s demise, when they should actually be focusing on their own impact.” I completely agree but I also want to add on to that. I think it’s absolutely important that everyone try and limit their negative impact and be aware of how much their actions actually contribute to propagating the crisis. But I think this also goes hand in hand with the larger economic or social problems that also need to be addressed. Of course, I think we should start with our own actions which we have complete control over before progressing to a larger scale. After all, it’s important to practice what we preach. In terms of moving forward regarding climate change, I absolutely want to move forward and focus on the future generations as well as our own so that we can come together and figure out what we can do but that’s made more difficult because the generation responsible for the climate crisis — the ones that started it all really — are still in power, making the big decisions that affect our country and communities as a whole. It’s difficult to get future generations involved when teachers are unable to teach them the truth about what’s really happening to their planet, our home. Therefore, I believe change to address climate change needs to happen on both an individual and social level.

While I holistically agree with everything that Ken stated in his video, I also have a hard time envisioning how I can do these 5 simple things without a shift in either societal and/pr governmental change in action. First of all, while I'd love to be able to move around California in a metro or a bus or any form of public transport, it is very difficult due to 1. the price 2. the lack of sufficient public transport in California and 3. the inconvenience. For example, to get to a train station for my dorm I will have to take an uber or drive a car because no bus can take me to my desired location, and there is no inherent metro or subway that is able to transport people to their desired locations. My point in saying this is not that I do not wish to change my transportation methods, but I am simply saying that in order for the mass population or even just a section of the population to start to adhere to a more sustainable way of life, the government also needs to make it easier and more desirable. I also say this because people will almost always choose convenience over anythings; therefore, people might take this class or watch this video and feel motivated to change their ways, like biking, taking public transport etc. However, over time they will become complacent, reverting back to the ease of just jumping in your car and going wherever you need, whatever time you please. 
<br><br>

When addressing plant-based diets, we need to change the stigma behind them; I don't know how many times I've heard my grandparents and aunts and uncles talk to my vegan cousin about the dangers of veganism. They still believe that a vegan diet does not give the individual the nutrients they need or require to sustain a healthy lifestyle. This is because of their fixed mindset about the importance of a 'balanced diet' and their stringent views that you can only receive the necessary protein from meat, and real dairy can only be acquired through Cow products. etc, etc. Therefore, the most important thing I believe behind changing the way people act is education, education, education!!! If people are more educated on the benefits of a plant-based diet, or even educated on how to compost their own waste then I am sure that more people will be willing to make the switch to a healthier, more sustainable lifestyle.

In this lecture, professor Hiltner mentions 5 things that our generation can do to mitigate the climate footprint in half. I felt ashamed when I reflected on my own way of life. Although I don’t own a car or a big house, sometimes I actually do waste meat and buy a lot clothes. It is incredible that I learned there is so much methane has been released by raising livestock and so much of chemicals has been created by producing clothes. It really changed my attitudes that I should consider more carefully before I purchase anything.
<br><br>

What’s more, some people may think that all of the five things sound like we can do at our fingertips, but being accomplished actually face great obstacles. As Ken said, it requires people, especially from the older generation, to subvert the traditional American way of life. I think the process won’t be easy since it not only means people could no longer spend the money they earned on whatever they want but also means to totally change a way of living. Nevertheless, if we instill this concept and take actions step by step, complete change would be reached one day, and we all know this day must come soon.

After listening to Ken’s advice on eliminating waste, I am glad that most of us are doing this right now. At UCSB, I found it amazing that most students travel around by bike, foot or public transportation. And for those who are driving, I observed that there are more people who have turned to drive electric vehicles. UCSB has been supporting faculty and students to eliminate waste and reduce carbon emissions. In terms of transportations, buses are free for all students, and there are bike paths everywhere on the campus. Besides these, they have also installed charging stations for electric vehicles and gave out EV permits. In terms of food, UCSB has been encouraging students to donate their unfinished meal swipes for those in need. Lastly, students at UCSB have been quite generous in giving out second-hand furniture to others. This is extremely helpful in reducing the carbon footprint. Saving the environment and reducing waste is really not impossible. Our school has already made it easier for us to act. I hope that we can all make good use of the resources.

I really enjoyed this video because I feel like we haven't covered a lot of what a single person can do to make a change in the climate crisis. A lot of times I think we take classes like this and we know that the climate needs help, but we don't always feel that just one person can make a difference. It's a twisted mindset to get in to because if everyone could believe that they could make change, then that's a lot of change. I remember learning about a study where someone was on the ground in need of help, and people were just walking down the street past them because they all thought someone else would help them. I believe that's what's happening right now with climate change. Everyone thinks that someone else is going to swoop in and make a big change that will solve the problem for everyone else.  Yes, that would make life a lot easier, but the fact that everyone needs to make changes to save the planet could also be a good thing for us as a race. All of our differences can't matter when we're all working towards a common goal.

<br><br>

What Ken said about his students disliking the consumer culture of America is accurate I believe. Most people in this class right now probably want to help, and are willing to try at least one of those 5 ways to lower your footprint. But again, it takes a certain selflessness to make real change. Being on an extremely bike friendly campus already makes me feel like I'm doing something. I really enjoy our way of getting around, but being from Seattle I also understand that you can't live like this a lot of places. It's not fun to bike in the pouring rain, and a lot of people are skeptical of public transportation. Places like New York City are amazing to me, as no one needs a car, and everyone seems fine with riding the subway. Also the housing situation is definitely a lot smaller just because of the price and sheer density of people in the city. Living somewhere like that is probably a great place to reduce your footprint, but it's also very expensive.
<br><br>


Having grown up in the age of thrift shopping is also something I feel like my generation has the upper hand on. I always thought it was normal to frequent thrift shops, then I have my mom telling me how she thinks it's so cool that people shop there now. The only issue with thrift shopping is the lack of convenience, in that it takes definitely more time and searching to find something you're looking for. Again, a small sacrifice that can be made for a large impact. Everything Ken suggested seem reasonable in my eyes, save maybe for the one kid aspect, as a lot of people want more than one kid, but I also think more people now don't want kids, so it may partially balance out at some point. I'm excited to learn more ways I can personally help the climate crisis, so I'm excited for the upcoming weeks of this course.

After watching both lecture videos, there are a few things it took away from each. The boomer generation video, professor Hiltner does a great job covering how early some people knew climate change was going to take place. Even though he said it wasn't an excuse I get the fact no many people knew about climate change. The average person at the time did not know that climate change would be inevitable due to them keeping up the habits they had. This video, "Can one Generation do what previous generations failed to do?" points out changes individuals can partake in to cut back the carbon footprint. However, the problem is how flexible people can be. The older generation I doubt would be willing to make these changes like moving houses or changing their diet. It is up to the new generation to make these sacrifices, since we do not yet own a home or have job that we can not relocate for. Also, I think it is easier for the younger generation to make the dietary switch. All these points add up and I'm glad they were pointed out.



</p><hr>


<p>

After watching both of these lecture videos the main piece of information that stuck with me was the idea that knowledge isn't necessarily power. Instead knowledge is only power if it is acted upon. Otherwise knowledge is just knowledge. I found this idea very important because we have the knowledge to make a change. However, the question isn't whether or not we have the knowledge but instead whether or not we have the will to act on this knowledge. The generation before us knew very well that there were environmental impacts as a result of their actions. Indeed they might not have known how severe these impacts were, but at the end of the day they had the knowledge and they did not act on it. It is now our turn to act on the knowledge that they had the opportunity to act upon.
<br><br>

In this lecture Ken gives five easy ways to cut your carbon footprint in half and many of these options are very simple and easy to accomplish. For example, switching to a plant based diet is extremely easy and not only is it good for our environment it is also ethical and very healthy for ones body. Another super simple way to make a difference is to buy less consumer products like clothes. Clothes have long lasting value yet everyday people go out and buy new items of clothing to wear simply for the aesthetic value. These changes are very simple and even just completing these two minor changes can make a big difference.

This may be the first time in the course where I am not scared for my future. Thank you Ken for creating this refreshing video on what my generation can do to help the disaster your generation created. Prior to attending UCSB, I was worried about not having a car on campus and thought of how much of a hassle it would be to get around without one. I was worried because my experience with public transportation growing up wasn’t the best. I grew up in Los Angeles where the transportation system is not the best as compared to the efforts other cities have made. As a third year in college who hasn’t brought their car to campus, I am more inclined to take public transportation than I was before. I think other people who have never considered public transportation before, including those not living in Santa Barbara, would be more open to using it if they knew how easy it is to take. On most online maps, there is an option to view the bus route you would need to take to your desired location. Aside from the things individuals could do, if cities were to create more frequent, convenient, and reliable stops, people would consider public transportation a lot more.  
<br><br>

Aside from the sense of relief I felt while watching this video, I couldn’t help but think “What about the major companies with investments in fossil fuels? What will they do?” This is the part that always stops me from thinking positively of the future. I can’t seem to get past the idea of those in power doing very little or nothing to aid the fight against the climate crisis, while those with less power than them doing all that they can to make things better. However, with the help of your five helpful things we could do, I'll remain optimistic of the future that is to come.

 I agree with your points. I feel relieved after watching the lecture video. I think that after each of us knowing what climate crisis is and what happened around us because of the climate crisis, we should not feel scared but motivated and hopeful. It is never too late to act. With suggestions from Ken: living in smaller apartments, or taking public transportation, everyone realizes and takes action. Also, you mentioned that if cities can create more stops, people would like to take the bus more. It is true. In my hometown, the local governments invest a lot on public transportation. City subway has 4 lines and it is convenient to take buses, too. A lot of people choose to take public transportations instead of driving cars.

This course offers me more knowledge and ideas about environmental issues. I had a greater understanding of climate change, and this course influenced me in some positive way. After knowing about the causes and consequences of climate change, I decided to have a green lifestyle. I am trying my best to save energy and reduce the damage to the environment. For example, if I can take the bus to a place, I would not drive. If I do not have a strong eager to eat the meat, I would eat vegetables. All of my change is brought by the course. Since we had a better attention about environmental issues, schools had set up a lot of classes to tell the students the knowledge of climate change. So our generation would have better knowledge about climate change. However, our parents, at their time, there were fewer classes or statements that telling them our earth needed protection. They would not care about climate change as we are. So compared to them, we can do much more things that they fail to do. For example, we can give up driving somewhere and choose public transportation. But our parents are hard to give up driving since they have driven for many years. They have so many bad habits, it is hard to change. For us, there is a chance to refuse these habits before we form it.

<p>

I think that the adaptations that Ken made are very doable and a step in the right direction, If you are fortunate enough to participate.  Often times we are told that we need to change our habits in order to save our Earth, but we often times do not know where to start. We sometimes do not even realize that our actions are causing a negative impact. By delineating an action plan of what we can change in our day-to-day lives this allows for many to take part in changing their life styles. I do agree that Americans are wasteful and need to rethink our relationship with material possessions. Our tiny changes will add up and allow for a sustainable and better reality for future generations. By watching this video it opened my eyes to the different possibilities of cutting back our carbon emissions. If by implementing these adaptations we are benefiting the Earth, why don't we do it?
<br><br>


To me it is insane that the amount of food wasted in the United States is between half and a third of what is consumed. I've known about this issue, but did not know the extremity of it. Coming from the Central Valley I am surrounded by the  agriculture field. Oftentimes food that is not considered up to par to the aesthetic of what we deem as acceptable for produce is thrown out. Nothing is wrong with the actual produce besides its outer appearance. We need to be more conscious of our actions.

After watching Ken’s lectures, I find that knowledge is so important. It is essential to make sure that everybody has enough education about what is happening on our planet. Environmental systems are complex and dynamic, so knowledge is essential. It enables people to understand and respond to the effects of global warming, improves climate literacy of young people, encourages them to change attitudes and behaviors, and helps them adapt to climate change related trends. However, in order to make a difference of environmental problems, it is never sufficient that only a few people participate in. As a result, education about environmental problems should be popularized to more people in the society. In this way, awareness about climate change and risks will raise and people are more likely to take an action to mitigate the impacts on environment worldwide. Compared to Ken’s generation, younger generation did a better job on the issue of climate change, because of the popularity of education nowadays.
<br><br>

Just as Ken mentioned, there are five things we can do to cut climate footprint in half. Changing transportation ways to walk or bike, moving to a micro apartment that contain co-housing communities, having more plant-based dies and waste less food, having no more than one child per family, and buying less clothes are effective. For most Americans, they will make a big difference in their lifestyles. Also, changing their lifestyles will bring a lot of inconvenience. However, doing these things can make our life better in the future. We are doing for our future generation as well.

I completely agree with the statements you made. "Knowledge is power." I think that our generation has the potential to make meaningful change in the way we live as it concerns the climate crisis. We were born in the internet age, and we are definitely better-suited and more receptive to tackle the challenges that the world is facing today. 
<br><br>
I also agree with your statements in how we can make change in our everyday lives. But the hardest part is the diet. A lot of Americans love their meat (including me!) and it is incredibly hard to start the switch to a more plant-based diet. Hopefully, with the advent of lab-grown meat we can start to see more people around the world adapt more eco-friendly diets.

We can do something we can in our daily life at first and change slowly. The most important thing is to keep climate change in mind!

After watching the lecture video, “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do”. Professor Ken Hiltner is doing everyone a favor, reminding everyone that hope still exists within the issue of climate change. I appreciate the methods and the tips that Professor Ken Hiltner provided and explained in combating climate change.Notably, I really enjoyed listening and exploring alternative methods such as changing our consumer demands, moving to a city and residing at a small eco-household, switching dietary plans to plant-based, and minimizing the growth of our population.
<br><br>

In the light of the feedback of alternative methods, I began to understand why the old generation did not see climate change as a serious issue or that they simply program themselves to think it doesn’t exist because if it does, then a lot of them will be forced to live in a lifestyle that they are not comfortable with. I could definitely relate to the idea that people “worked hard” to achieve their dreams that allowed them to consume and enjoy the resources around them without being questioned. However, nothing in this world is unlimited, none of our personal gains will matter if we do not have a planet that is suitable to live in. Everyone must do it, not just the new generation, not just the old generation, but everyone. Everyone has a role in “making the world a better place”. We must act on the alternatives that were showcased to us by the video and spread these ways to us before it's too late.

I too enjoyed listening to Ken’s lecture video, “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do.” I often feel as an individual that the effect and thus the change I can bring to climate change is very negligible. But he listed a few tips on what we can do to do our part. Also I realize that my way of thinking is partly why little change does happen because if everyone feels they cannot contribute then nothing will be done. It is also hard to get a significant amount of people to work together to achieve a common objective. Even though many people may share a common interest (in this case we can say fighting climate change), each individual also has conflicting interests which is why it is hard to achieve this task.

Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?
<br><br>

I’m glad this question of “What can I do?” is being addressed because it is something I have wondered about a lot in the past. Of the five things Hiltner mentioned (diet, housing, transportation, stuff,  and family size) I was glad to see that I am doing my part in housing, transportation, and stuff. I live with three housemates in an apartment, I don’t own a car and bike everywhere, and I only buy new things when necessary which is rare. The areas where I lack participation in doing my part is family (because I am 21 years old) and diet. I do not eat a plant-based, although I do eat almost completely dairy free. My main problem is that I enjoy meat, and it is a habit of my diet. I mainly eat poultry and fish, which I know is better for the environment than red meat, but occasionally I do eat red meat. What I try to do is sometimes eat a meal without meat because although it is not ideal, I am at least doing something to help.

What the Boomer generation knew about the climate crisis - and when we knew it
<br><br>

The fact that there were many politicians, scientists, and members of the public that predicted the climate crisis and our dependence on fossil fuels, and yet there were no changes made to everyday life does not surprise me. It doesn’t surprise me because it has taken this long to barely begin taking action and making a difference. The common public still isn’t doing very much to help the climate crisis, and some don’t even believe it is occuring. I believe it will take a long time for the world to make a dent in the climate crisis, because it is very difficult to influence someone’s everyday routine when they are comfortable in it.

I really appreciate Ken's passion on helping the planet, especially with this lecture. I am choosing to comment on this lecture instead of What the Boomer generation knew about the climate crisis--and when we knew it simply because this lecture involves our generation and what we can do about taking action for change. I believe our generation can take action and make a change for our planet's well-being; although, in order to do so, we much all be determined and motivated to do so. Once we are determined and motivated to take action, we can simply include the adults in our lives--including our parents--with this help, a difference will be made. If most of us actually wake up to the fact that we must take action, we just may be able to elongate the planet's life. The cruciality of our generation and everyone else on this planet to take action must be made as soon as possible. With the factors provided by Ken in this lecture that can simply help may not be too difficult for our generation. With Ken's first suggestions about transportation and housing, within our school and even the other UC's, this action is not too difficult to partake in. Many of us attending UCSB either live on campus or near campus, I believe getting around campus is not hard if you do not have a car. Many of us are either walking or biking, and even with this small action, it simply makes some impact on helping and favoring the planet. If the majority of us can simply just walk and/or bike to get around, so can those who have cars. As for the suggestion of switching to a plant-based diet, I can see the difficulty in this switch. Many of us enjoy eating meat, including myself, but to partake in this suggestion, we can simply start off by eating at least one meal that is fully plant-based and slowly progress from there. With Ken's final two points made of population and purchases, I believe those two were personally eye-openers. Lately, I have realized how overpopulated our planet is. Many individuals in my generation are having kids, not for the sake of their wants, but simply unwanted pregnancies. Unwanted pregnancies are within itself a hard topic to discuss, but knowing that our planet cannot support the amount of increasing population that will continue to grow really puts a lot of pressure on unwanted pregnancies and maybe even on those who continue to bring upon children in this world. As amazing as bringing life into this world is, many individuals should think about the worth of bringing new life into this world. The other factor about overly purchasing items really hit home for me. I tend to overly purchase items that I do not actually need and this is very bad due to the carbon footprint. Knowing that taking part in all five suggestions that Ken stated in this lecture will cut your carbon footprint in half simply motivates me to do so and I hope others watching this video as well.

<p>
One of the biggest reasons I manage to stay somewhat optimistic about fighting climate change is that my generation is much more progressive. This lecture also helps to improve the optimism because I think, even though we are rather progressive, we can be a bit pessimistic. Many of the things listed are things our generation has already been doing (or has begun doing). My grandmother was telling me how it seems like everyone’s vegan nowadays, and I was explaining to her that there’s nothing wrong with that and that it’s actually good for the environment to eat a plant based diet. She responded with “I could never” which I found really funny but also the comment reflects on how older generations feel in general about steps we should take to reduce the consequences of climate change. They feel like they have been fine their entire lives by not doing those things, even if they were somewhat aware of the consequences that would come. 

<br><br>

I think it’s important to note that, in regards to housing and transportation, much of our generation does this because, well, we’re broke. When I go on twitter, I see a lot of jokes about having kids in this economy because we can barely afford to take care of ourselves. I feel like we should just be aware of that as we go about suggesting ideas that some of us don’t really have a choice but to do so. Also, from the perspective of a low income student, I used to want many of the things wealthy people have such as a very large home. My mom wants me to be able to provide those things for my family in the future, taking them out of poverty. When I suggested a smaller home in the future, she didn’t understand why I would want to settle for less because I don’t come from a lot. I think for us who struggle financially it becomes a strange feeling and can take long to adjust to the fact that if, when we are finally able to afford them, buy big homes and the newest automobiles, we’ll be contributing to the consequences of climate change. Because American culture is so fixed on having a bunch of materialistic things, it makes it really hard for people who can finally afford them to not indulge. Not to say this is an excuse to indulge, just offering a perspective of why some people rely on materials that make them happy.

There are many strategies proposed in an attempt to mitigate the climate crisis and significantly reduce CO2 emissions. While all these ideas are commendable, what will prove to be the most efficient is directing focus on lifestyle changes to reduce emissions. While this lecture describes many feasible ideas, they will all have to be extremely ambitious. Transportation, travel, buildings, and homes will need to make significant improvements. Companies and homeowners will have to switch to more renewable sources of energy such as solar to cut emissions. This is a more realistic approach since regulating large corporations will require too much political and economic change which people are not ready to give up. This ambitious standpoint for transportation as well as lifestyle changes are necessary. If regulation strategies do not get implemented in the next few years, the climate will reach the point of no return. The world will be a different one than we see now as the full blown effects of global warming will start to show. As carbon emissions increase temperature in yet another natural system, the threats to the balance of Earth become more eminent.

I found this lecture very interesting and really made me think about the way I live my life and that change is necessary for the prosperity of our earth. Ken lists 5 ways you can help combat climate change and get involved. These ideas are centered around transportation, housing, diet, etc. As many people I know have already made changes in their life, such as becoming vegan/vegetarian or driving an electric/fuel-efficient vehicle, there is still more that we can do to cause change. I know it is hard for people to change the way they live, but small steps lead to eventual bigger change. One of his ideas that influenced me was switching to a plant-based diet. I have read articles of athletes and actors switching their diets and feeling better than ever. As well as personal health, the videos I've seen of the way cows are being mistreated and how much cruelty is going on just so we can have a burger is nauseating. I am currently trying to ease into switching my diet, realizing how much better for the planet it is. Thankfully, for our campus and how close everything is in Isla Vista, a bike is a great mode of transportation and I rarely ever drive. As far as children go, as I currently have none, it is definitely something that I will think about in the future. I really enjoyed the lecture Ken gave.

I agree with you that this was one of the most interesting and relevant lectures so far. Listening to Ken list those five ways made me realize how easy it is to change my lifestyle. Cutting out meat and fish does not only help the climate but is also a lot more ethical and healthier. Especially now that I am living on my own and can make my own decisions about what I eat every day, I find it even easier to be vegetarian - hopefully, I will soon be able to cut out animal products completely.
<br><br>
Switching to public transport or biking instead of driving is another aspect that I find relatively easy to implement. Like you said, living in IV, everybody bikes everywhere anyway and, to be honest, I absolutely love it. Not only is it a lot better for the environment, but I am also being physically active on a daily basis which my body will later thank me for. Regarding public transport, I have honestly never understood why so many people hate taking the bus or train. In my opinion, I find it relaxing just looking out the window, listening to music, and not having to worry about being stuck in traffic or driving myself. When I was in high school, sitting on the bus on my way home was one of the only times I could truly relax every day.
<br><br>
Even living in an apartment sounds way more appealing to me than in a huge mansion. I never understood the American ideal of "the bigger the better". Why would you want to live in a massive house with way more space than you actually need? I would prefer a cute, small apartment in the city where I am surrounded by people and places, instead of living in a suburb with nothing but homes. 
<br><br>
All of the things Ken mentioned seem very possible to implement. I bet most people would be surprised how easy it actually is to change their lifestyles - and maybe they would even prefer it that way. I hope in the future we get more lectures like this!





</span></div><hr>

<p>

Although I already knew these suggestions for reducing one’s carbon footprint, I did not know that the implementation of them would result in at least a 50% decrease in an individual’s carbon emissions.  This fact not only surprised me but gave me an even stronger desire to make change where I can.  The fact that older and younger generations see these changes in such vastly different ways did not surprise me; it was not a revolutionary concept that giving up on the american dream would be incredibly challenging for older generations to accept.  In my opinion, this is because the older generations equate money, property, and social status with living a successful life and thus a promotion of happiness.  However, for younger generations, it is becoming more and more clear that success has nothing to do with money and happiness has nothing to do with how many houses or cars or clothes one owns.  Because of this, the younger generations are more willing and ready to implement these small changes in their lives.

<br><br>

Additionally, it is much harder for older people who have been working hard to achieve financial freedom their whole lives to suddenly give up on these resources in hopes of solving a crisis many do not believe is actually happening.  It is much easier for those of us just starting our independent lives to invest in living sustainably because we do not have to give up possessions we have worked our whole lives to own.  Due to this, I understand the older generations reluctance to make changes in their lives in order to live more sustainably; however, I still find this incredibly worrisome.  While it is hard to give up on an old way of living and move to a new one, it is much more challenging to reverse or mitigate the effects of climate change, a burden that has fallen on the younger generations.  This can in turn impede on the younger generation’s desire to live sustainably because of the realization that we comprise such a small portion of the population willing and ready to make changes that we may not even make a noticeable impact.

"Knowledge is power" but power is useless if it is not used. Our society is squandering the time we have left before the positive feedback loops kick in ending any chance we have of keeping our climate normal. We have to do something as a society to capitalize on whatever time we have left. We can't blame past generations and hope that they will fix the problems they left us, we have to blame them while we fix the world they put on the path to destruction. Their actions will affect me, you and all those that follow us. The green new deal championed by AOC and other democrats is our best shot of realigning our economy to not only work for the citizens of the united states but to also incentivize a more sustainable form of living. 

<br><br>

It is also worth mentioning that I think the claims made by my peers about how such a radical shift in economic and social policy wouldn't have any negative effects are irresponsible. The working class may benefit from this but it will come at the cost of the federal government and large US businesses, in an economy where these two entities fall from power, there will be some negative repercussions, but to what level it is impossible to say. Our society changed once we began our centuries-long love affair with fossil fuels, and our society will change again when we move on from fossil fuels and change brings bad with the good. We may be ready to change but not everyone is content to throw everything we can to fix our climate and if we can't enact these changes together than all we can do is wait for the climate to irreversibly shift.

However, I have some ideas on how we can save our planet (not everything has to be gloom and doom):
<br><br>


Reduce, reuse, and recycle,
<br><br>
Carbon tax
<br><br>

Reduce meat consumption 
<br><br>
Public transportation
<br><br>
(Please comment your own ideas below)

I couldn’t agree more with your statement, "knowledge is power" but power is useless if it is not used.” But one could also say, power is dangerous if it’s in the wrong hands. When we think about the debate of climate change, we notice that even despite being scientifically proven, climate change is still questioned. Bringing me to my point that knowledge can be powerless if the power is in the wrong hands. Suggesting this to be an explanation to how our elected politicians can turn scientific fact into something of political controversy. Bringing me to my argument that, money influences our politics. The power of money is illustrated by the way the fossil fuel industry has become a very dangerous and very powerful player within American politics, policymaking, and the topic of climate change. Serhat, you asked for us to comment our ideas on how we can save our planet, my idea is that we need political change. We need to take money out of politics. If we take money out of politics, the fossil fuel industry will no longer have power within our politics and policymaking. If we make money powerless within our politics, this power can be used to save our planet.

I would love to say that I am a pretty green person but after watching this lecture video, I could confidently say that there is so much more that I could be doing. When Ken talks about reducing our car use, I felt like he was talking to me through the screen. I definitely am the type of person who will drive their car down the road for some ice cream when I could bike or walk. Another thing that got me was when he said that couples should only have 1 child. I come from a really big family and I want that family dynamic in the future. However, I know how much trouble our earth is in and it sounds extremely ely selfish for me to sit here and say I want a big family but I also support and want to make a change for our environment. That being said, I feel slightly bette5r knowing I am really conscious about fast fashion and how much meat I consume.

I completely agree; I consider myself to be an environmentalist and someone who is committed to changing the course of the climate crisis, yet there are so many small things I can and really should be doing without exceptions. I think I tend (and probably a lot of other students as well) to really go for the big picture in terms of how we can make a change. In an ideal world I picture myself helping to change legislation or protest the big cooperations harming the environment, etc. etc. While I think it is great for people to keep these goals in mind, it's also crucial to remember that climate change is occurring as we speak and we can't imagine a better future if we don't start living sustainably today. I feel I do a pretty good job staying away from plastic, but that is such a small fraction of the damage humans cause. I hardly think twice each time I fill up my tank. Driving back and forth from SB and SF, where I live as well, is probably the worst thing I do for the environment, and yet it never crosses my mind to think of more environmentally sound options. I know flying is not any better, but simply being a car-owner has so many negative affects on the environment. 
<br><br>

I think it is unfortunate that so many new hybrid and electric cars are so expensive. I would love to own a sustainable car but as a student it is simply not realistic for me. All of this being said, there is always something small we can do, pretty much at any given point on our day. But the small things don't mean we can ignore the big things. I should try to make my next car at least hybrid if I am going to continue to drive this much, and I should think about sustainable housing in the years to come. And of course we shouldn't lose sight of the really big-picture ideas that require political involvement and ingenuity. We are the perfect age to start making our own positive impact while also planning ahead for a much, much more progressive future.
<br><hr>
I 100 percent agree with you that I tend to only see the big picture when it comes to what I can do to stop my carbon footprint and impact on the climate. However, this video showed me that it's the little things that really make a difference. I don't have to immediately stop eating meat, only shop at thrift stores, and sell my car to help the fight against climate change. We are all capable of living sustainably if we take the small measures towards that. Plastic is a really good example of living sustainably, and I think I, among others, have taken the steps to reduce the amount of plastic we use whether it be through a metal straw or reusable cup. And I also agree wholeheartedly about the electric cars. I personally drive a Honda but I would trade her in immediately for an electric car just because I know how much better they are for the environment.

Like I’ve written in previous comments, there is a lot of weight placed on the shoulders of our, my fellow students, generation. It feels as though the survival of the planet is on us, whether we choose to take action or not. I think Ken’s five steps to combat climate change are possible but aren’t entirely simple. Being a college student at UCSB, it’s easy to go from driving everywhere to now biking everywhere. Cities like Boston and New York have the subway or the T, which can take you to practically anywhere you need to go. Cars are not desired and not needed in large cities like these. But in cities like LA, where there is no underground transportation system (yet), a car is useful. Cars, however, are practically necessary in rural towns and the suburbs. It’s insane and impractical to say that everyone should move to a big city. Cities like New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles are already over populated as it is. 
<br><br>

I don’t think it’s necessary to live in a mansion or a large house in general, but it’s hard to say people shouldn’t do that, or that my generation should stop desiring large houses. As Americans and a first world country, we always want the biggest and the best. We grow up with that mentality. It seems unfair though that the past few generations have been able to live in grand houses, although that is only a small population, and now my generation is suppose to give up that dream and move into small houses or apartments. Housing however is a major issue. The prices are high along with the demand, making buying a house or renting an apartment impossible for a large amount of people all around the world. 
<br><br>

With a growing population, the demand for resources in sky rocketing but the supply is still scarce. I agree that the population needs to be cut back but I don’t think people will listen or like it if they are capped on the number of kids they can have. 
<br><br>

We live in a consumerist society, one in which we value material items. This will not be easy to change. People are always trying to show off what they own and are never satisfied with what they have. I agree that this needs to change, I just don’t know how or when that’ll happen.

It's not going to be easy. However, that doesn't mean we can't start now, and do our part even if not everyone else will. We've been equipped with the knowledge of what needs to be done to reduce our impact, and simply bringing that knowledge into our day to day life as we make decisions about our consumption and choices can and will have an impact. 
<br><br>
Luckily, we are adaptable. We have the ability to radically change our own lives at any point. We can and will adapt to this way of life in time, despite how hard it may be, because we NEED to. Because there's an urgency. Because at the end of the day when we're overridden with fires, floods, refugees, death, and everything else that will come as a result, it's not going to matter how much we love our big houses and our material items and our cars and our meat--life as we know it will already be changed. Change is coming either way, it's just a matter of how far we're willing to let the problem progress until it does.
<br><br>
Of course, even if we get everyone on board to do these five things, it won't be enough. It's been found that just 100 companies are accountable for 71% of climate change, so if we don't tackle the issue from the head of our country as well, none of it will matter. We need to work on the issue from both the top and bottom: that's how change will be accomplished, and we need to start as soon as we can.

This lecture was particularly interesting to me because I feel as if most of the time we learn and read about how doomed we are rather than advice to make the change. It is common to hear and see rallies, marches, and protests for climate change which are definitely effective in bringing awareness to the topic. But with that being said, it is not as common to be told, ¨Here are five things you can do and in turn, your carbon footprint will be cut in half.¨ I think this is both helpful and important because at least one or two of these pieces of advice will resonate with people and they will consider it. It also did a great job of answering the lecture`s title, which when posed as a question, is effective in pulling the reader in and leading them to the answer.
<br><br>


Of the five pieces listed by Ken, the plant-based diet stood out to me because of its impact. In this course, I have learned all the horrid truths behind the meat industry, and now I do believe I am going to make the switch for environmental reasons. While that was the most stand-out point to me, the most surprising had to do with living in a city apartment. I always associate smog and pollution with cities but after reading this it changed my outlook because one produces fewer emissions in a smaller house, and cities also offer public transportation frequently. All five points were helpful and easy to keep in mind every day, and I hope they continue to grow in popularity while trying them all out myself.

I appreciate the different take from urging to vote and partake in activism. I wonder what can we do right now today since human action brought climate change, what personal actions can avert climate catastrophe, and Ken delivered.
<br><br>
I would like to detail on the five things he talked about that would arguably cut my carbon footprint in half. The first recommendation was transportation. It’s a quarter of our carbon footprint and instead of driving and even flying everywhere for our convenience, we should take up public transportation and biking / walking. As a college student, I’ve experienced the shift of having my family’s car to my convenience to traveling on the bus, biking to school, and walking around IV and campus. It’s definitely a benefit for us students to take the bus for free and I feel very grateful for it. I actually love the fact that I have public transportation and even bike more (the commute from Santa Catalina and back really burns those extra dining common calories) and when using it here, I wondered why we don’t emphasize city buses and bikes to our advantage. His second proposal with housing, another quarter of our carbon footprint, and taking up smaller apartments and cohousing instead was interesting to hear. I always saw the ability to own a home as top tier accomplishment, but a minimal apartment could also be really nice. If I do happen to live in the city, it would go hand in hand with the first recommendation as I would expect myself to use my car less and take on more eco-friendly, efficient housing. The third point would probably be what I would struggle with the most, due to my roots of being a picky eater and my taste buds’ adoration for meat. I have considered eating cleaner for health reasons and gradually eating less meat for the sake of health, animal treatment, and our world. As for children, I actually want to adopt and I think that’s something Ken did not mention (unless I missed it) and that would help bring zero humans into the earth while providing for those already here. Lastly, thrift stores for my generation are IT! Spending less and getting those hidden gems that were preowned. I even had an experience with IV trading post and enjoyed its execution.
<br><br>

The point of that ramble was to realize that I did take in these recommendations in a mostly positive light and resonated with Ken’s past students and their reactions versus how his generation takes in these five ideas. As you said, it is nice to hear advice to make the change rather than read how we are doomed. In all honesty, from taking this class, if I were to not start implementing or attempting to implement these things, I would be a hypocrite on top of guilty. Since I do want to be a lawyer, I am starting to envision my life living in the city of my firm instead of commuting from my suburban home. In contrast to this, when I told my mom I would go to a thrift shop with my friends, she got kind of grossed out and said just go to a cheap store like Ross or Marshalls for low prices instead of taking in the clothes of strangers. I had to go in secret. I love my mom, but this is a clear distinction of responses between my generation and hers. I’m hoping when I come back home, I can bring up these five points to the entirety of my family and hopefully inspire them.

After studying abroad in France and traveling to different cities across Europe, I realized many things about my own lifestyle and things I can cut back on. First, I learned how little clothes I needed to survive my everyday life. When I moved to go study abroad, I was already limited on the amount of clothes I could bring with me, but really only wore half the clothes I had brought. When I returned to the United States and saw the rest of my wardrobe, I was almost disappointed and disgusted by my possessions. Rarely do I feel a need to shop for new clothes now, and even if I do, I would feel guilty buying something “brand new.” Another significant part of my experience while I was abroad is how I traveled to 7 countries and 15 cities without driving a car. The public transportation within cities, between cities, and between countries is so efficient, accessible, and environmentally friendly (for example, you can purchase a “CO2 Compensation Ticket” when traveling with FlixBus, one of the main bus companies in Europe). I hear people mention how bad public transport is in America because you need a car to get ANYWHERE (hence, issues like “LA Traffic”), but after experiencing the ease of travel on a smaller carbon footprint first-hand in Europe, I truly wish it was possible to travel the same way across different states in America. 
<br><br>

Lastly, living in Isla Vista has taught me ways I can incorporate environmentally friendly actions into my everyday life. I have been fortunate to live with clean and responsible roommates who make living in a small apartment very comfortable and home-y, and not like your stereotypical “college apartment.” For example, I moved to a smaller sized bedroom this year and actually enjoy the smaller space between my desk, bed, and closet. I also find that a smaller apartment is much easier to clean and, like my clothes, I don’t need a lot of space to live comfortably every day. I have also started to incorporate composting into my routine because there exists a composting program in Isla Vista! Currently, the compost collective is inactive, but that has not stopped me from composting. My understanding is that they ran out of funding to pay people to pick up your compost, but it is not hard to take your own compost out to their designated compost area. Just do it yourself! I love how my community has programs like this that make it easy for their community members to do good.

Ken eloquently explains the difference in lifestyle mindset between millennials and boomers. It is crazy to realize the different way my parents’ generation grew up and how my (Ken’s students’) generation grew up affects our values and way of thinking. Comparing the way my generation and Ken’s generation reacts to the 5 things Americans can do to dramatically reduce our climate footprints makes this contrast starkly evident.

<p>
This lecture starts with a question-form title, which invites the reader to think. After watching the lecture, I'm sure the answer to the question is yes, but the process won't be easy. As Ken gives out 5 things that our generation can do to cut climate footprint in half, I believe they subvert the traditional American way of life, which Ken also mentions and responds the query in his lecture, since people no longer can live, drive, buy, eat, and wear what they want if they take Ken’s advice. It’s also the reason that I said the process won’t be easy, as it not only asks people to change the way they live, which some may be used to it for decades, but also challenges right of freedom. Therefore, in order to completely make the switch, people need to start with making small changes, for example trying to purchase less clothes per year. I believe the power of smalls steps can lead to big ones.
<br><br>

What’s more, Ken compared the average size of an American house with that of a traditional Japanese home. I understand that the comparison of numbers is compellent and shocking, yet we need to acknowledge that the household in Japan is famous for its small size due to overpopulation and limited landhold. Hence, I think it’s quite unfair to take such extreme situation into comparison.

I do agree with you that some of Ken’s suggestions and comparisons are extreme, and that we cannot ask people to change where they have chosen to settle down or how many kids they have had. However, understanding that, as Ken mentioned, generations respond differently to climate crisis, I think that these extreme comparisons are a good way of teaching the newer generations how we can change our lifestyles. For people ages 18 and under, many have not chosen to settle or have children yet, so the tips Ken gave will help them to reduce their carbon footprint. I do believe that we can change the idea of, as Ruiya said, “the traditional American way of life”. Rather than mansions with garages containing 10+ cars and meaty dinners each night, we can change the American dream to be living sustainably in a city and being able to walk to work. If we teach the newer generations that this is the only way our planet will survive, they may decide to life in such style. As Ruiya mentioned, Japanese style housing is famous for its small size and is due to “overpopulation and limited landhold”. As this is specific to Japan, this could soon be the American future if we continue to overpopulate. I’m sure that many young adults do not see this as a possibility for their future, but this could very well be what Americans must turn to in order to sustain our population. If we each limited ourselves to one child per person, as Ken said, we could avoid this.

After watching “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do,” it gives me a thought that the after generations can make up the mistakes that made today. As the professor Ken stated in the video, there are more positive views than negative views. For example: we can have at most two kids in each family, buying less consumer goods and release less pollution. So that we can have a better earth for our next generations. As the population goes down, food situation becomes better, transportation becomes more convenient and less needed. The environmental problem will be solved by our next generation.
<br><br>
At first, I totally disagree with the author the propose, because I believe as the technology becomes more and more developed, the environmental problems are more difficult to be solved. If we decide to live on this planet and let's start to do something that can help this planet to become a better place, let's not consider what will our next generations would do, because if we always put off the problems to our next generations, the problems won't be solved at all. 
<br><br>
But after I got the whole point of the author, I begun to agree with him, because as the next generation's technology becomes better, they can actually solve more problems than we do.



</p><hr>


<p>
"Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?" provides audience five essential ways to make up what human beings have done wrong in decades to save the Earth. The five methods are following: reduce usage of cars, choose smaller houses, eat less meat, give birth to fewer kids, and buy fewer things. Overall, I believe the solution is related to "materialism". Though it is easy to say and people might have thoughts to practice these in a short time, it is hard to keep doing what is good for the earth. As the video said some people might relate this to "freedom" and this is what Americans always go after, so it is very hard to keep people from pursuing what they want. However, in the given situation, rather than connect those solutions to freedom of choices, I probably would say it is more about selfish. Definitely people can to purchase whatever they want, have as many kids as they can afford, live in a large house if they can buy it, etc. But only if they understand that the consequence will be paid off by their offsprings, by other people who cannot afford it, and even by non-human lives. Thus comparing to describe it as "pursuing freedom", I would rather say it is just "materialism" and greed of having more. Although it is really sad to see some of the responses, I still believe that we should promote theses solutions to more population. We are weak as one person, but strong as a group, even a little bit of change of all of us will make a huge difference.

<p>
I wouldn’t say these 5 things are an easy lifestyle changes, but definitely do able. I grew in Los Angeles which is not only densely populated with people but the grand majority of residents in Los Angeles also cars and drive them daily. It might seem easy but I feel that most Americans and even those of my generation are going to struggle in this change of lifestyle, it something that a lot of us have grown accustomed to. However, that is not to say that we can’t these changes are vital for all life on the planet and shout therefore be taken with extreme seriousness. 
<br><br>

 For me the hardest is going to definitely be my clothing and diet. I eat a lot of beef and I am very much into into clothing especially sneakers. Therefore, I am going to have to make some difficult changes however, it is all for the better. It’s not a matter of difficult anymore it a matter of saving our planet.





</p><hr>


<p>
I'd love to see Ken provide some solutions to reduce environmental issues. Honestly, I didn’t know that moving to a city can reduce carbon emissions (I thought urban emissions are more serious). I'm sure those methods can greatly reduce our carbon emissions, and I want to give some tips. 
<br><br>
Transportation. Imperfect transportation facilities hinder people's dependence on public transport. That is how I feel. Sometimes I need to spend half-hour waiting for the bus and end up taking uber. With the support of governments, it may be better.
<br><br>
Housing. Moving to another city is not easy because you need to say goodbye to your friends and your neighbors. Changing the size of the house is difficult since it would cost money. Therefore, instead of moving or changing, focusing on other strategies would be practical.
<br><br>
Wasting less food, that is absolutely our duty. 
<br><br>
Changing diet. It is true that consuming less beef can improve our climate. However, only eating vegetables increases the risk of joint pain and intestinal bacterial disorders. Hence, eating chicken, fish instead of eating beef would be better than changing to a vegetarian diet.
<br><br>
Having fewer children. I believe that no one in the modern age wants so many children. If you really love kids, adopting is helpful.
<br><br>
Changing relationship with stuff. To be honest, this is definitely the most difficult part. With the rapid development of science and technology, all kinds of goods attract customers, including me. My suggestion is, buy what you need. Avoid purchasing unnecessary products not only imposes positive effects on the environment but also save your wallet. ^^

When I was younger, I remember how much more ignorant society was about the climate crisis than now. Society was not nearly as much aware of the climate crisis as we are now. With the uproar of social media and easy access to the internet over the past decade, the public has begun taking a few steps towards reducing their carbon footprint. New trends including having a reusable water bottle, becoming vegan/vegetarian, using reusable straws have definitely influenced our society into becoming more conscientious about climate change. Although, there is a lot more that we need to do in reducing our carbon footprint, this is definitely a start. Like I have said in previous comments, educating the public is key to implementing these changes into our daily lives. Without the correct information, people are not likely to make the best possible decisions when it comes to dealing with the climate crisis. 
<br><br>

I believe what works in a society like the United States is to have an incentive alongside these sustainable acts. For example, why reusable water bottles have become so popular is partly because various fast food chains offer a percentage off a beverage if you bring one in instead of wasting their plastic/paper cups. If there is not an incentive offered, it is most likely that the majority of the public will not be willing to change. Instead, the public may feel threatened by progressives. I believe in the fact that we can change as a society, if we reframe the way we look at sustainability. Sustainability is often viewed as a loss or major switch in living style, but in order for change to occur people need to view sustainability as a necessity.

I found this week’s lecture particularly interesting.  One thing that stuck out to me was what Ken says he commonly hears in response to his recommendations for personal changes that people can make in their lives.  While Ken has heard mostly, “Is that all?” and “That’s not too bad,” attitudes from our generation, I find that it makes a lot of sense that older people tend to think the opposite.  We find that politically, the older generations tend to lean more conservative.  I learned in a political science class that I had last year, that this is primarily because they tend to be a little more “stuck in their ways.”  Younger people are just starting our lives, and so these changes may not seem as dramatic as they do to those who have lived completely differently for their entire lives.  However, I have also heard a fair amount of defensiveness from the younger generation as well, as was mentioned in class this past week, as “moral laziness.”  I, myself am a pescatarian, and a lot of my friends tend to say things like, “I wish I could do that but I just love X too much.”  I found a tweet a few months ago that said something to the effect of, “it’s okay not to be able to commit to something 100%. If you want to be vegetarian because you want to make a difference in the climate, but you can’t seem to give up cheese, that’s okay.  Start with what you feel like you can do.”  I think that this can apply to all 5 of the things that Ken has mentioned.  Making small changes in your diet, transportation, waste, and relationship to stuff is okay too.  While a larger change from everyone would be ideal, it can be understood that it’s not realistic.  Therefore, decreasing your consumption in each of these areas is still useful, and if everyone thought this way, it could still make a big impact.  

<br><br>

I appreciate that Ken also touched on the previous knowledge that the older generation had.  While I knew that a lot of the issues causing the climate crisis arose during the mid 20th century, I didn’t realize how much they knew.  I think we all chalk it up to ignorance.  In reality, ignorance is no excuse.  This just highlights how much we all need to educate ourselves now.  We cannot repeat the ignorant mindset that the boomer generation had.  It does however, make me wonder why greater changes weren’t made.  The fact that Ken was mentioning that most people if asked randomly on the street would be aware of the issue was surprising to me.  If so many people knew, why was change not being made on a greater scale?  It’s disappointing to say the least, and I hope that our generation doesn’t act in the same way.

I completely agree with your claim about the reluctance of older generations to accept changes to their way of life. I think that the five lifestyle changes that Ken brings up in this lecture are not much to ask for our current generation or future generations because we will see the benefits of these lifestyle changes. Compared to the generations before us who have lived their whole lives with a more wasteful lifestyle, it is more difficult to make such drastic lifestyle changes.
<br><br>
Your comment refers to the older generation as “stuck in their ways”, I feel that this is an accurate characterization. As demonstrated by the book and video that we were assigned to view in addition to these lectures, the majority of climate change deniers are from this older generation. It seems very likely that they are less likely to accept these lifestyle changes because they have seen nothing in their lives that would indicate such drastic consequences. 
<br><br>
The other lecture video refers to the fact that previous generations were aware of the consequences their actions would have on the planet, but I feel that for this older generation to truly accept that climate change is occurring they will have to see major changes to the planet. Meanwhile, our current generation seems more open to these lifestyle changes because they have more to lose if these changes are not enacted. To the older generation, these changes represent fundamentally changing their way of life. To the current generation, these changes represent a necessary change to ensure future life.

<p>
The most impactful take away from this weeks lectures is Kens quote, "of not acted upon, knowledge is squandered." When watching the first lecture "what the boomer generation knew about the climate crisis -- and when" i was reminded of the concept of diffusion of responsibility. Essentially, the concept states that when a group of people all witness a catastrophic event, which they are all capable of acting upon, most people will not act. This is because the responsibility to act does not belong to each individual but to all of them togehter, as they are all aware and cabable of the need to act. The climate crisis puts this concept into effect on a global scale. I have little doubt that if you approached each student at UCSB, each american, or each global citizen individually, and asked them if they would change a major aspect of their diet or daily lives to save the planet they would say yes. Unfortunately, one person changing their lifestyle is not enough to have an effect on the situation. The crisis is not personal, everyone must act. Thus, unless a global force illicits change in the lives of every human being, it is relatively unlikely -- from a psychological standpoint - that enough people will act. Unfortunately, the concept of a global force making this choice for us is not as abstract as it may seem. Many "alarmists" urge that the state of the climate will eventually force the hand of humanity into action. This raises another conundrum: If we will eventually be forced into action, why change until we absolutely have to?  There will be some benefits in our lifetime if we do choose to put off addressing this issue, just as there was in the boomer generation. The problem is, if we continue to put off facing the repercussions, they will only worsen in magnitude. Additionally, those most affected by the detriments will be those who reaped the least of the benefits. Essentially it boils down to a fundamental question: do you care more about humanity or yourself?

The ways to reduce our carbon footprint are easier said than done. Admittedly, I know that changing my mode transportation, living in a smaller house, wasting less food, having less children, and not consuming materials would greatly reduce my carbon footprint. Adjusting my lifestyle to these changes makes sense, but I have difficulty actually acting. I have made some changes that Ken mentioned, but I could be doing more. Living in a smaller house and having less children do not apply to me at the moment, but transportation, food, and consumption do. 
 <br><br>

One large change that I have made is my diet. I used to eat meat every day, sometimes multiple times a day. Since I have learned more about climate change in the past year or so, I now eat meat about two-three times per week. I also have greatly reduced eating red meat, where I consume it a couple times a month, sometimes not at all. My goal is to continue to reduce the amount of meat that I eat, even if the process for me has been relatively slow. Further, I appreciate Ken mentioning the need to change our relationship with material goods. Many items of clothing are made of materials such as cotton, wool, polyester, etc. which take a long time to decompose, and during that time, they release methane. Repurposing and recycling these materials are a great way to reduce our carbon footprint. 
 <br><br>

Knowing that ways to reduce our carbon footprint are possible is reassuring. Like most things in life, if people are willing to work hard toward things that are possible, then change will occur. Knowing a few ways to reduce my carbon footprint and realizing I am acting is encouraging. I still have a lot to change, and for the benefit of the planet, I am certainly willing to act.

I think what Professor Hiltner is saying in this video is very progressive and I completely agree with his ideas, however I find it difficult to justify that my small actions can make a difference. Hiltner says we need to stop using our cars, live in a smaller space, change our diet, and have fewer children. These ideas all make sense to me and I want to participate in this minimalist lifestyle, but how do I know that my small lifestyle changes will actually make a difference if not everyone is doing it? Like Hiltner said, his generation hates the idea of making do with less in their lives, so they obviously will not change. Would my single lifestyle change actually make any difference at all if an entire generation refuses to do the same? I do try to live a sustainable life as much as I can, but is that worth anything when everyone else around me is not doing the same? I feel like the only way for people to actually abide by this way of living is to make it a law and I’m not sure if that will ever happen, or that it will happen soon enough.

After watching this lecture video, I am beginning to feel a sense of direction in the climate crisis. Compared to the lectures of the last two weeks which filled me with an overwhelming feeling of despair and hopelessness, “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?” has made me more confident about the future. I do really value the issues we learned about in the first two weeks. It is important to understand what will happen if no action is taken. Looking back at the comments from the previous videos, I see that many other students held the same sentiment that while Ken was telling us that we need to take action, he wasn’t giving us any specifics. Now, after watching this video, I know that along with voting and supporting green policies, there is much more that the individual can do to tackle the climate crisis. 

 <br><br>

Ken lists five ways in which you can live your life in order to reduce your carbon footprint. The first two are downsizing transportation and housing. Ditch the car as often as you can to walk, bike, or use public transportation. The average American family does not need to be living in a large suburban home. It is better to live in a smaller home, or even better an apartment. Ken suggests looking to live in a city where smaller living quarters and public transportation are more common. The other three lifestyle changes are wasting less food and eating mostly plant based, not having more than 2 children in your lifetime, and finally rethinking your relationship with stuff by rejecting consumer culture. I believe that by teaching these steps to the younger generations so that they can implement them into their future is extremely important. I know that we are open to these sweeping cultural changes and that the American culture that we know now will be so different in the upcoming years.

Ken's video did a great job of informing about what we normal people can do to improve the environment, or the climate. His five good examples really give people.  If we can choose a better way of transportation( or moving to a city),  choice of housing, waste less food, having. no more than 2 children, rethinking our relationship to stuffs. These make great sense to me especially the last one: we should rethink our relationship to the stuffs. Lots of my classmates, or people care more and more on their appearances, or their outfits. Therefore, they are tending to have a greater demand for stuffs like clothing. Lots of brand will design new clothes for their needs, and they will buy them. However, this is kind of waste of resources and money. What's worse, it will have negative influences on the environment. I just think sometimes people should care more about the necessity of the items instead of just the outlook to reduce waste and improve the environment. I am not saying it is a wrong way because it is their freedom to buy new clothing if they have money to do so, I just think maybe it could be better if everyone cares more about it.

The generational gap in thinking and responsiveness to lifestyle changes definitely exists as Ken describes, but I also think that it is important to consider cultural background. Especially in coastal and more diverse areas like cities, a large percentage of Americans are immigrants or strongly connected to a specific ethnic background. I feel like this is important to consider in the discussion of what people can do to combat climate change. For example, my mom is an immigrant from Japan and has always incorporated minimalism in our household. I grew up not buying into the American mass consumer culture and being told that large families are not desirable. However, when I brought up to her that I was trying to eat a more plant-based diet, she was shocked and completely closed off to the idea that I wasn't eating meat or fish: since this is such a huge part of Japanese culture. Meanwhile, my dad is from the Midwest and very American, but his generation (he's older than most of my peers' parents) was very much impacted by living through wartime and having austere lifestyles. So while he is American in many respects and part of an older generation, he is in some ways more open to environmentally-friendly lifestyle choices. My point here is that this generational gap is only one aspect of how people respond differently to making changes in their lifestyle. In order to reach the majority of Americans, we need to consider ways to acknowledge cultural differences and lifestyles when promoting these changes. 
 <br><br>

I think this is especially important because the move towards vegetarianism/veganism, public transport or limiting consumerism/shopping second-hand is heavily equated with privilege, whiteness and trendiness in big cities and coastal areas. For those who don't identify with any of these, it can be difficult to imagine living this way. And I believe that this keeps a lot of minority and less-privileged people or those who live in more rural/suburban areas to feel like they will be able to make these changes and not sacrifice heavily for it; even though taking public transportation, shopping second-hand, living in smaller spaces, eating plant-based diets and having less children can all save money and resources. Beyond just enjoyment and excitement associated with living large and exuberantly, there are other things at stake for many Americans.  I think that it is crucial to acknowledge that part of why people in older generations may shy away from these changes is that the they think the lifestyle suggested doesn't allow for the cultural practices and traditions that they have held dear for their whole lives. If we can shift this narrative to not link so strongly to images of white, young, liberal people who have the "privilege" to devote time and energy towards making lifestyle changes and trade efficiency for environmental friendliness, this solution to climate change could probably reach many more people.

I really liked how this lecture detailed the exact steps we could take to reduce our contribution to climate change. The advice in this lecture really resonated with me because I grew up in San Francisco CA, a densely populated city where parking is impossible to find and people live in small apartments because housing is so expensive. It never occurred to me that we were in fact reducing our carbon footprint by doing this because a lot of San Franciscans live this way purely because of economic reasons. It’s not feasible for everyone to afford a large house in a place where the median price for a single family house is $1.7 million dollars. 
 <br><br>

From his other video “What the Boomer generation knew about the climate crisis – and when we knew it,” I really liked the following quote. “If acted upon, knowledge is power. If not acted upon, knowledge is squandered.” Our generation has all of this knowledge and we still have the opportunity to act on it so we have to take advantage of this chance.



</p><hr>


<p>

In regard to the things Ken suggested we could do to help reduced our climate footprint; I think the one that could be the easiest to transition to would be having no more than one child. Unlike generations in the past where they had up to ten children in one household, our generation seems to be having less and less interest in doing that. Most of the people I know, including myself, either don’t want to have kids or they at least want one. Of course, we can’t account for unexpected pregnancies but for the most part we seem to be heading on the right track population wise. As for the other four suggestions, those are going to be quite hard for some people to wrap their head around. 
 <br><br>

A good thing that I see that’s happening is that in the past couple years, thrifting has become trendy and many teens and adults have been participating. So maybe the fifth suggestion; buying less clothes, keeping what we have longer, and thrift shopping will stick to the younger generations and we keep it going. The ones I see being the most difficult to have people transition to is housing and transportation. People don’t want to go from living in the privacy of their own homes to community housing with less space. I’m not saying it’s impossible, it’s just going to take longer for people to come around and see that it’s not as bad as it seems. Same goes for cars, for so long we’ve had this easily assessable mode of transportation to take us from point A to point B with no hassle whatsoever, not many people are going to be willing to let go of that so easily. We could offer alternative options like biking, busing but those are already options and people still choose cars.

My parents migrated to the U.S. in the late 80's in search of the American Dream. The ideal that all Americans can achieve upward social mobility through sacrifice, hard work and risk taking. For many people coming to America from developing countries meant that they had a greater chance of success, which would most likely be defined by the amount of money you have, what kind of car you drive, what kind of house you live in and the amount of children you are able to support. 

 <br><br>

I think that a lot of the apprehension to living more sustainable lifestyles comes from people's interpretation of what success is, and how leading a sustainable lifestyle (using public transportation, biking, living in smaller housing, having fewer children) doesn't fit into the mold of what a "successful" person should look like. To most, a successful person has a big house, doesn't need to rely on public transportation and can have as many children as one would want. This is dangerous. We need a huge cultural shift in what we interpret as success and happiness, and not define these things on how much we're able to buy and consume. I see many influencers and celebrities also perpetuating overly indulgent lifestyles as successful to impressionable audiences, when they could easily use their platforms to speak on climate change and change their unsustainable lifestyles.
 <br><br>


The 5 steps that Ken outlined to minimize our carbon footprint left me very hopeful, and I could see many people at least taking more precautions on how they can live more sustainable lifestyles. For example, if one is not able to completely cut out animal products, merely cutting out the consumption of cattle makes a difference on one's carbon footprint. I also feel hopeful that many of my peers are already taking steps in the right direction, and Santa Barbara is the perfect place to practice sustainable living. We have access to public transportation, miles of bike lanes on campus, and most students already share housing. These are small changes in the right direction, but I think the largest change that we need to see is a shift in our cultural perception of what success is.

Covering a five step summary of a great place for each of us to start on reducing our carbon footprint, I think that this a wonderful message to spread to show the ease in which we can take steps today on our own to save the future of our planet and humanity. Surprisingly, I found as I was listening to these suggestions, that they seemed so basic and common to my senses. It suddenly dawned on me how crucial education and repetitively hearing certain things is. I say this, as I suddenly recalled my middle school environmental science class, my high school AP environmental science class, and now, ENGL 22 and ENGL 23, two more environmental science related courses. In each of these courses, these five steps have been embedded in their teachings and overtime, have become second nature (almost like “duh”) information that just seems right. If we were educated with the wrong information, imagine the consequences for the future generation? This is in reference to this week’s reading, but also tying into this lecture. While population definitely is an issue, and some sort of control or stabilization is necessary, like explained in lecture, it is important to recognize that this is crucially in relation to our consumption and living habits. With an exponentially growing population, our bad habits will only increase exponentially as well as we demand more things, more food, more space, more destruction, and just an abundance of other practices that are taken up in order to keep our planet afloat for our population only, not the well-being of our earth.
 <br><br>

Changing food habits, undeniably, and other habits like transportation and living styles, are a feat and difficult to begin with. Change is hard. You have to really put your mind to it, and start one section at a time. On a personal level, I can relate to the particular section on rethinking our relationship with things. Being materialistic is a trap hole, and with our consumerism age rising, this is a common thing that many people unknowingly find themselves being, not willing to let go of things, and wanting more and more, the newest and best. I remember when I first came across Marie Kondo’s show, differentiating between things that actually sparked joy and those things we are keeping that actually had burden to ourselves. Watching the show and cleaning up my clutter at home truly was as professor Hiltner said, a common response from his students and our generation, that not only does this whole process not sound too bad, but sounds exciting and desirable, as I found clearing my clutter out of my life felt, all the while reducing my carbon footprint when I reconsider all my purchases.

Switching to a plant based diet, driving less, having less kin, etc will all greatly help the planet and reduce C02 emissions. These are all great things to do, but from a historical perspective, we have not done this. In order for this to be effective, everyone would have to be on the same page. Its highly unlikely that the majority of Americans will do such a thing when meat, driving, and family life have been so heavily integrated into our nation. I understand that it is only a suggestion, but it is still very unlikely and therefore probably not a viable way to save the planet. Political action would be the next best bet to stop c02 emissions. The problem with this? Politics have always created more division and conflict, when saving the planet would have to be a unified effort. For this reason, political action is not necessarily the most efficient option. I think our best bet that we have to save planet Earth would be to use all of our energy and funding on scientific research to develop a technology to eliminate c02 from the atmosphere.

I was deeply elated to hear what personal changes we can make in our lives to reduce our carbon footprint and actively participate in the fight to save our planet. I do believe that voting is of the utmost importance, considering that the majority of those who have the power to make the most efficient changes toward reducing greenhouse emissions are those who do not believe in the climate crisis. Other than this, I was very curious to learn what other personal changes I can make to feel like I am doing something progressive for the future. Of the five changes proposed, many of them seem quite easy for me in my current living situation. Luckily, I go to a school that relies heavily on bike transportation, I have already transitioned to eating completely plant-based, and I do not have any children. Housing and transportation are the two that will take slightly more effort to implement into my life, but they are completely fair and reasonable, especially when I am constantly reminded of what is at stake. I believe the majority of us can make at least baby steps to transition to a more environmentally friendly lifestyle. Not only will it help the climate, but by driving less and taking other modes of transportation and eating as plant-based as possible will be extremely beneficial to your health.
 <br><br>

 I am glad to obtain this knowledge, not just for my own well being, but as Ken mentioned I intend to act on it. This class has turned me into somewhat of an environmental activist in the sense that I am constantly telling my family and friends about everything I learn. I have become very passionate about the topic of climate crisis and all I want to do is share it. It is one thing to tell them what they can do to help better our climate, but after hearing all the scary and informative facts behind it all, is when I really grab their attention. Even in my daily life, I can recount at least two times when I decided to bike to my destination instead of driving after learning that the average American driver’s car emits almost half of the total carbon emissions of one person in China. That resonated with me, and helped me make the better choice of transportation. I hope that I can at least move a few people to make better choices by spreading what I learn in this class to as many people as I can.

It is not just the older generations that fail to change their lifestyles. I know many people of my generation that refuse to use public transportation, wish to live in big houses in the future, claim to ‘love meat too much’ to give it up, and think thrifted clothes are dirty or gross. All of America and many parts of the world are guilty of living for instant gratification and having the mindset that ‘bigger is better'. I think it is important for the whole country to have a change in mindset. I think people need to be more aware of their lifestyle choices and actions in relation to other people and the future. Not everything is about materialistic goals that make you feel good in the short-run. 
 <br><br>

I grew up in a big meat-eating family as it was part of our culture. I used to be one of those people that laughed at and didn’t understand how vegetarians lived their daily without consuming meat. Soon after when I discovered that there was such a thing as vegans who didn’t eat milk or eggs products on top of that, I was absolutely baffled. I would ask, “Why would you do that to yourself? I could never give up something as good as bacon or cheese.” But as of today, I have been vegan for 4 years and cannot express how glad I am that I made this change in my lifestyle as it has improved my overall quality of life. Eating plant-based is so much easier than it seems and than one would think. It comes with so many benefits people are unaware of including better skin, digestive health, kidney function, heart health, and so much more. People also underestimate the power of influence. After going vegan, I noticed so many of my friends trying vegetarian options at restaurants or even dabbling in vegetarianism or pescetarianism. My family’s consumption of meats and dairy has also greatly decreased as they continue to want me to be able to enjoy meals with them. 
 <br><br>

These suggestions in lifestyle changes that Professor Hiltner provides are far from unreasonable or impossible. They are all of reach and do not hinder us from living a life of fulfillment. Living sustainably is living for the future and with regards to matters other than our own conveniences and comfort.

Professor Ken gives many ways for us Americans to decrease our footprint starting with transportation. Owning and driving a car account for a quarter of our carbon footprint alone. Instead we should try to walk, bike or take transit. He recommends straying from a large suburban or rural home and instead look for a micro apartment. The easiest way to accomplish both of these would be to live in a city. Most people are using walking as their main source of transportation and most all homes are apartments anyway. Food Production is the second largest contributor to green house gases. To help with this problem we can stick to eating a plant-based diet and cut down on food waste. Personally I think that the beef industry needs to be shut down for good. Nothing good comes from; the cows pollute the environment and beef really isn’t a healthy meat to consume. Ken also tells us to stick with having 2, 1, or 0 children. I always wanted three kids and never even thought about the environmental problem with it. The planet simply cannot sustain this many human beings. We also need to cut back on our consumption as everything we buy has a carbon footprint. Instead we should try to shop at thrift stores more often. From the video it seemed that people in my generation are more open to making changes to their life for the sake of the climate than people of Ken’s generation.




</p><hr>


<p>

The five suggestions from Ken looks easy, but actually hard to do, at least for me it is. In the first week of taking this class, I was noticed that eating beef is actually harming the earth. So I told myself that I need to say goodbye to beef. It is actually going well during the first three days since Portola didn't have beef or it looks awful. But I failed the next day. I like eating meat, beef is the best, chicken is good, pork as well. So isolated from meat, especially from beef, I can't. Right now, what I am doing is reducing the amount of meat every meal. 
 <br><br>


Ken was also mentioned transportation. It is a good idea, but I see the difficulty. It is not our's difficulty, but US transportation's. I lived in Santa Catalina, and every day I go to school by bus. Could you imagine the experience of waiting the bus for more than 30 minutes? It is the lack of US public transportation. If the country wants people to give up their car and move to public transportation, you have to let everyone see the benefits of taking public transportation - cheap, convenient. I have to say that in China, everyone put public transportation as a primary choice. I can take the bus/subway anywhere in the city and go anywhere I want, and 5 mins are the longest time of waiting. Meanwhile, if your destination is not that far, you can rent the public bicycle by scanning the QR code on the bicycle, and those public bicycles are also everywhere. Only if the government makes public transportation better, which is even better than driving your own car, you don't even need to force people taking it, they will take it as the first choice.

Well, what can we do to help the environmental change? I have received several suggestions in these years when I grew up, like eating less meat, riding bicycle instead cars, buying less useless things, and do not waste food. For one hundred percentage sure, I tried and did lots of times, with my hope that the global warming could get better situation. However, from the data in these years, I can tell from a normal person in the planet, it did not get the problem solved even slowed down a little bit. So, I am confused and worried that changing my lifestyle could be helpful to save the environment or not. Because it really needs individual to keep the fairly simple lifestyle with no car, old cloth and all-vegetable diet. I can admit that sometimes I do not follow those lifestyles since I kind think changing lifestyle does not helping the global warming. After the video, I get the faith that changing lifestyle really can save the planet. As long as everyone tries to change, the climate crisis can be solved hopefully. If you change your lifestyle but nothing big change in the environment, you may regret in your life time that lots of things you did not enjoy. But, if you do not want to change, the whole generation will use their lifetime for regretting that why did they not change formly.

This is a very great lecture video. I think it is very helpful to our generation. Some of the suggestions are great. The carbon footprint from me is huge. It is because I am not living in the city, where there are massive transit or micro apartments. Driving a car to school on a daily basis is a bad idea, but I have kept doing so. Living in a big house in a rural area is a bad idea, but I have done so. I might not be able to change it right now, but doing better on food and trashing are doable. After watching this video, I believe this will change my lifestyle drastically. Relating to my generation, I am glad in Santa Barbara and Goleta, cities largely student based, co-housing is a very common phenomenon. People share rooms and houses, which decreased the carbon footprints. Also, many students at UCSB decide to bike to classes, this eliminates the release of greenhouse gases significantly.
 <br><br>

In my generation, a common lifestyle also includes carpooling. More and more students decide to buy a bike instead of a car. People living in the same house, typically share the car and go to classes together. Sometimes, people living in the same community share cars. People go to LA on weekends, but we do carpool, which is environmentally friendly. When we are visiting friends or family out of state, we need to go to LAX, more and more people go there by Santa Barbara Airbus. In housing, I know there are many communities nearby that are just leasing homes. Which are mostly smaller, and people can only rent but not purchase. This is a very good way of helping the climate. Those are what we are doing or did as a new generation.

<p>

Although I know that the climate crisis is real, I feel guilty when thinking that I am not contributing to the efforts of minimizing the effects of climate change. After watching the lecture video called, Can One Generation Do What The Previous Generation Failed To Do?, I now know that I am in fact helping minimize the carbon emission by using public transportation, cutting beef from my diet and buying less clothes. Even though I am making an effort, not all people in society are and I don't believe that it's their fault necessarily but rather the standards imposed by society onto the public. In America, for example, the societal culture bases itself with materialism. In the country of wealth and abundance, people are meant to have the luxury cars, parked in front of a big suburban house, with a large family of three to five children and all those children are meant to have closets filled with clothes and shoes. The culture embedded into the United States makes it very difficult for the people to change their lifestyles as they have been accustomed to this and undoubtedly it has become second nature to them and in addition to that, people base their socioeconomic status on appearances. 
 <br><br>
The second lecture video titled, What the Boomer Generation knew about climate crisis-- and when we knew it, discussed how the phrase “knowledge is power” is a false statement. People, other than climate crisis deniers, do acknowledge the fact that the climate crisis is our present reality yet they don’t do anything with the knowledge they have because if you somehow don't think about the issue, the issue isn’t there. This scenario can be described as turning a blind eye onto the burning house. It is difficult for people to acknowledge the truth to begin with but it is something completely different and almost impossible to make people change. People lack the incentive and initiative to change their materialistic and excessive lifestyle because they don’t wish to change. Period. I honestly don’t have a clue about what will be the cause for which people will begin to take into account changing their current lifestyle but I just hope that when that moment does come it won't be too late to take the proper actions necessary.

Both lectures this week were very interesting to me. As soon as I started this class I was curious to see what I could do to lower my carbon footprint, though I did already have some ideas in mind of what I could be doing. I’ve heard it so many times that going vegetarian/vegan or mostly just on a plant based diet could help lower our planet’s CO2 emissions significantly, but I never thought it was something I could really do. I tried going vegetarian my sophomore year of high school, but my mom made me stop because she said I would not be getting enough enough nutrients without eating meat or protein. This discouraged me and I went back to eating whatever I wanted. This class has really inspired me to at least start with having a meatless day once a week. Going plant based for many people would not only be good for their health, but good for the planet.
  <br><br>
As for what we buy everyday and what we consume, I am extremely guilty of purchasing clothes from the fast fashion industry and in general just being really materialistic. I have been shopping at thrift stores more often though and even purchasing second hand clothing items from the UCSB free and for sale Facebook page. I know that a lot of people work to have nice things, such as a nice car, nice home, and nice clothes, but I think we can live without consistently having to buy things and overall just not be so materialistic. I am personally  going to work really hard on this. In terms of the world population, I think our generation is for skeptic about having kids considering we don’t know how long are planet will be able to sustain a planet that will allow them to live. Also, many people in my generation have been waiting until they are much older to have kids compared to past generations. A lot of people I know don’t even want to have kids. I think if we try to start small in these changes, it will add up and we will be able to start to move toward lowering our carbon footprint and saving our planet.

I could definitely relate to your situations! I became vegetarian my freshman year of high-school and for the same reasons started eating chicken and fish again because my mom was worried for my health. I think that the belief that the best source of protein is meat, needs to be broken. I feel that if people were more educated on the amount of water and land it takes to produce beef then they would reconsider how much they eat of it. Surprisingly, a lot of college students either don't know much about the climate crisis or are barely learning about it. I feel that if an intro course to environmental science was offered at every high school and was maybe even made a requirement, our generation would be more woke and more helpful in this crisis. As to purchasing clothes from fast fashion companies I also know that its hard to not buy cute clothes! Especially when there's so many advertisements being thrown at our face to buy this and that. Its hard! But it honestly really helps to delete these kind of apps and it feels even better to save money! (Haha). It's definitely hard to change our consumer ways when we have so many things ready for us to buy and even more when your feed advertises specifically to our taste (which is weird sometimes but that's another topic). It's unfortunate that because of the previous generation, we have to make tweaks to our routines and habits but I like to think that it's a good thing to consume less, it means we won't need more to be happy and live comfortable, it'll make us more humble.


<br><hr>

Especially given the sense of impending doom I felt at the beginning of the course, I am certainly feeling very willing to subject myself to whatever necessary restrictions I should impose on myself to fulfill the recommendations in the Paris Agreement. While I have not converted to vegetarianism yet, I have made sure not to purchase products containing palm oil and beef. Fortunately, although to my own personal detriment, I have a clothing purchasing rate of about 2 to 3 articles of clothing annually. I have considered taking the time to make a system of tracking my personal carbon footprint easily throughout my daily life to get a rough idea of how well I am doing in being part of a progressive future. I am of the belief that one must not remain inactive merely due to the potential inaction of others; instead, be proactive and trust that people around us recognize that people are taking action and will feel pressured to do the right thing!

I actually did think that the suggestions weren’t that bad. Living at UCSB almost fulfills the transportation, since I can reach almost everything I need by biking, and housing suggestions. If I could live without roommates, my current situation would be quite enjoyable. So, the suggestions didn’t sound that bad. It would be fun in an ideal environment, but not everywhere or everyone can live in a place that easily allows these suggestions to be conveniently followed. Overall, I felt that I could achieve these goals, but the following part of the lecture reminded me that not everyone can or wants to.
   <br><br>
The two answers from the older generation really reminded me of my own desires.  I’m (mostly) enjoying my life right now, but my life could get way better. Instead of a small room shared by three people or a small room of my own, why not get a nice room where I can actually move about? I’ve been studying for most of my life in order to improve the living conditions of my family. The fact that I immediately reconsidered after hearing the first answer from the older generation just shows how embedded into our society working for wealth in order to be free and comfortable is. I grew up with a specific vision of what I wanted in mind, and when I was reminded of that dream, my current situation didn’t seem as fun. 
  <br><br>

I’m still shocked at how fast I changed my mind and realized that the changes, which seemed initially easy and possible, were actually more demanding and different from what I had planned for my life. I’m stuck between the second response from my generation and the first answer from the older generation, even though I know living sustainably will benefit me and everyone greatly. I acknowledge the difficulty in noticing how we are affected by American culture and recognizing that the American dream isn’t that great anymore. 
  <br><br>

 In the second answer, the American way of life sounds like the most obnoxious and wasteful way of life. It reminds me of Generation Wealth, a documentary on materialism, celebrity culture, and the desire for wealth. Although the first answer seems reasonable, the second answer irritates me because it sounds privileged, entitled, and spoiled. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to enjoy what you’ve worked hard for, but saying that we should be able to do whatever because it’s part of our culture, our American way of life, is annoying and wrong. People should accept and realize that the American way of life isn’t necessarily right. It’s normal to want to be comfortable, but being comfortable shouldn’t be at the expense of others. It’s just hard for us to change because we don’t see how our actions negatively affect others.

I would like to add one more thing, but what I believe is arguably the most crucial thing to do, to that list. I think that changing our lifestyles in small but meaningful ways to reduce our carbon footprint in the ways that you outlined should be taken as a given, and that the main objective of our climate activism effort must be directed towards the battle against misinformation. As you have shown us in recent articles and videos, the corporations established your time are not only dedicated to and proud of their "progress" that is destroying the environment, but are also making an active effort to convert the minds of this new generation to the consumerism, climate change denialism, and large carbon-footprint lifestyles that are the fatal flaw of your generation that all subsequent generations must now pay for. As informed individuals with drive and energy to play our roles in repairing the climate,  we must direct our energy towards the massive threat of malevolent misinformation, else we lose the ability and knowledge to reverse the damage done forever.

After watching this video, the proposed solutions as to how we can reduce our carbon footprint are so simple, yet difficult in so many ways due to how we have been influenced to live a lavish lifestyle. The American Dream is something that I had in mind throughout the entirety of this video. As Ken stated in this video, “The generation controlling our planet has been crafting and settling into a way of life for decades now that is quite likely an environmental nightmare.” Older generations have been shaping the modern world in a way that has blinded us from truly seeing the impacts of our lifestyle. I think the lifestyle that has been influenced upon us since the very beginning of time has really impacted us in a way that not a lot of people often think about. It has blinded us from seeing our individual impacts on the climate. Before watching this video, it never really crossed my mind as to how living in a house increased my carbon footprint. This video has really made me realize how our lifestyle greatly impacts the environment. As stated in the other lecture video, “If acted on, knowledge is power. If not acted on, knowledge is squandered.” We can take this information and do nothing, or do something knowledge that can create a ripple effect. In this case, by integrating 1 out of 5 of the solutions proposed has the potential to decrease our carbon footprint greatly.

It’s nice to hear Ken say that whether we choose to ride a bike or eat plant-based it is important and crucial to environmental activism. I’ve been vegan for almost 2 years now and although I love it, I’ve been through moments of doubt and pessimism thinking that what I’m doing isn’t going to help because I still see so many people eating meat. Once I get out of that funk I can realize that small actions actually do make a difference and it reminds me of a quote that reads, “I cannot do all the good that the world needs, but the world needs all the good that I can do.” When it comes to food waste, it’s actually one of my biggest pet peeves because it’s preventable. I’ve lived with family members who completely overbuy groceries and almost know that they won’t get to it before it goes bad, but buys too much anyways. I try my best to not waste any food and I basically only throw food out if it’s inedible - which I compost. Consumerism and climate change are deeply intertwined which is detrimental because of how rampant consumerism is. As Ken said, thrifting is one of the best alternatives to buying new clothes because it discourages the production of new clothing. Throughout the environmental movement, I think a lot of self-evaluation takes place because you must ask yourself what really matters to you. When you’re faced with disasters that are due to climate change you question if buying new things is important or valuable. 
  <br><br>


The 5 tips Ken gave are super simple and easy to be implemented, but as explained, there will be someone who responds with defense. The mockery of the typical American who wants to claim their freedom and rights was funny because it’s true, but when I hear someone actually saying they don’t want to be told what to do because of environmental regulations it makes me cringe. Overall, the climate crisis is hard to navigate because it’s deeply personal and begs you to reassess your ethics.

<p>
The solutions that Ken has proposed in this lecture are doable. And I have considered ways that I can live that will reduce my footprint besides living on a plant-based diet. It is weird because my parents do not consider these alternative living styles as "living". I tell them that we only believe this is true because of this lavish American lifestyle that we aspire for. But I have also considered their standing point on a deeper level. My parents grew up with less than comfortable lifestyle. My dad has parents who were working to provide for 6+ kids who were not all biologically related and my mom had a hardworking single mother who provided for her by working 3 jobs at a time. Their lives were not privileged at all, so they aspired for bigger and better than what they had throughout life. So not everyone wants to participate in this consumerism culture but rather have things that they never imagined they could have. Like Ken said that some of his generation wants to keep their fancy cars and large houses but there are also people who just want to own things they've hustled for. 

  <br><br>

So what I really want is for our way of thinking about lifestyle to change. While moving towards less consuming lifestyles, we will change what means to be a successful, comfortable person. You don't need to sacrifice your footprint to live comfortably. Minimalism, van life, tiny houses, plant based diets, and more could be the new lavish lifestyle without wasting and consuming.

<p>

When Ken mentioned the opposing views against changing our consumer culture, such as the perspective that we should be allowed to have it all because its the "American way" of life, I feel that the commonality of this belief is very upsetting. I feel that in a holistic view of our way of life, we have been surrounded by luxury and excess. Due to this privilege, we have been accustomed to desiring the greatest amount possible. However, this is a privilege that we have created into becoming seen as a necessity. Just because it has become the "American Dream" does not mean it is the right way of living, as we are being ignorant of our excessive ways and the damage it is doing to our planet. We have become comfortable in our destruction of the planet as we do not even think twice of our decisions as a consumer. Due to the fact that we have been lucky enough to not personally experience the effects of climate change, we feel disconnected and immune to the consequences of a dying planet. As a result, there is a misconstrued understanding that we do not need to change our way of lives, due to previous generations of climate change not getting the full attention it deserved, not that it even gets the attention it needs now. The view of the "American Dream" is the reason why the United States is one of the top contributors to anthropogenic pollution, behind all the glamor and convenience there is a devastated planet.

This is exactly the response and approach that I had to this video (and the following one) as well. Transportation, housing, less food waste/a plant based diet, one child per person, and rethinking our relationship with “stuff” all seem simple enough. Like Ken said, this is how many students react. But also for many others and the generation before us, the response is much more hostile. This is because these steps mean a complete rebrand of the American dream. And not only for America, but for the rest of the world that wants to be like us. American culture has been so instilled as the gold standard and goal lifestyle for the rest of the world, especially developing nations. The example we set has to be completely altered in order for these changes to really mean anything. Some of these changes are easier than others, but either way implementing all of them on a large enough scale is gonna be tough.
 <br><br>
 The facts and long-known knowledge in the second video only support how difficult this change will be. In the past 60 years the problem of climate change has been a political issue, yet little to no policy changes have been made. Even with extensive knowledge by the 1970’s of our fate, the American way of living clearly only grew and gained more following. If we’ve known how to help our situation for so long, and so little has been done, it only really goes to show how deeply rooted our way of living is. This video was disappointing and frustrating, but I still have hope that our generation can implement the changes the ones before us could not, and we can have a significant enough impact to help ourselves from what is waiting for us.


<br><hr>
I 100% agree with you. The way we see our lifestyle is not one of fortune and a privilege to have, but one that we Americans see as a necessity to life; a way of “normal” living. As Ken mentioned in the video, about how Americans want bigger houses, the new styles that are in (clothing, shoes, purses, etc…), a big family, as well as wanting to eat anything and everything because it is accessible. The average American eats more than other people from other countries. We are so gluttonous in our eating habits that it is affecting our climate as well as a shortage in water in some areas; I can’t forget to mention that it is also affecting our weight size. The United States has the highest population of obese people because all kinds of food are available in such a close proximity i.g. fast-food restaurants, dine in restaurants, food markets or grocery stores, and many other means of obtaining food.
<br><hr>
Consumer culture is such an integral part of American culture that I am hesitant to believe that we, as a society, will be able to transition into a time where we limit our consumer tendencies. As time progresses, so will our technology and our products. Although I do believe that in order to mitigate the climate crisis, we need to be mindful as consumers and lessen our carbon footprint, the American lifestyle is centered around lavish living and constant wants. Throughout Ken’s video, I could not help but think about the rich. The rich fly around in their PRIVATE JETS, own multiple cars, have multi-billion dollar homes for often just their family, and seemingly give no regards towards climate change. Yet, they are the ones who are living the best lives and will be the last to feel the effects of climate change. In the video, Ken talked about the evolution of the American home and how it is getting bigger and bigger, despite families actually getting smaller. And my question is, why do we feel the need to live the most expensive life we can? The generational differences in this mindset was very interesting, because I believe that it is also a cultural difference. As a child of immigrant parents, there never really was a drive to have the nicest things and live the most lavish life. The generations before me were more focused on family values and having enough to live a comfortable and modest life. However, I can see how the older American generation would not be willing to give up their life of material things because they feel that they “deserve it”. This just screams privilege, and quite frankly, it’s selfish to be causing so much unnecessary problems for the environment.
 <br><br>


With that being said, It is important to note the other ways in which we can personally fight climate change as well. I never really thought about how moving to a big city would actually be helping the environment and help reduce your carbon footprint. This would make sense though, since cities are highly invested in public transportation and apartment housing. This changes my views on big cities, which I always saw as a place for major pollution and the reason for global warming, rather than a place to help reduce it. My main concern for these tactics however are the effectiveness of them. I’m sure that changing to a plant based diet will help reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, but how much change do these individual actions actually have? I argue that any action, no matter how big or how small, is a form of climate activism because each individual action in solidarity with one another can work together to contribute something big to the issue at hand. This is why it is so important to take Ken’s suggestions into consideration and continually be more conscious about the decisions we make and the potential consequences of our actions. 

 <br><br>

If we do not, we will fail to learn from the past mistakes of the older generation and once again, ignore the pressing evidence and warnings made apparent from climate scientists. I am not sure how much time we have left until the conditions of Earth are beyond repair, but I do not want to sit around waiting to see what that will look like. I really appreciate the sense of urgency that Professor Ken puts into his videos and the historical background he gives on the issue. This is why voting in this upcoming election is important for our generation! In doing so, we are taking our agency and power, and using it to seek real change in the corrupt government.

I have attempted to become vegan at least four times in the past few years and have nonetheless failed each and every time. However, I found my silver lining in this process of attempting to become vegan and have managed to maintain a pescatarian diet for the past four years. My previous attempts to become vegan have mostly been because of my dog. After having to raise a puppy, the thought of killing and consuming a four-legged animal became unimaginable to me because of their sudden resemblance to my dog, whom I love so much. After learning more and more about climate change, however, I realized that not eating meat constitutes to so much more than animal cruelty. It constitutes to the question of whether our planet and our own kind survives or not! I used to feel somewhat proud of becoming a pescatarian, but now I feel rather pressed to do even better and make an effort to support my own planet. Hence, I will once again attempt my journey to an environmentally responsible diet, keeping in mind that this change will serve a greater purpose for my future on this earth.

 <br><br>

Another monumental portion of fighting climate change is to adjust the essential idea of consumerism. Unlike diets, the mindset of consumerism is what I think more people will have problems changing. Since our culture is filled with mass consumerism, it will be very difficult to alter the public's mindset to buy less. Especially nowadays, with the rise of social media and celebrity culture, perpetually everyone is exposed to the lavish lifestyles and wealthy habits these influencers are representing. Hence, it's extremely hard to ask of someone to not want something that is preached everywhere they look. Consumerism is so prevalent in the western world that "retailed therapy" has been coined and used widely. The idea of shopping for happiness has penetrated every corner of our society that I think is and will continue to be a significant obstacle in our fight against climate change.

After watching this video, I began to have a better understanding toward the question "how can we improve our environment." Before attending the class, I did not have a cognition of how damaged our environment is. But after attending this class, I did have a plan for what we can do from ourselves in order to make the earth a better place to live. 
 <br><br>

People always put their own profit o benefit in the first place which means we are selfish. People would like to eat more meat and fewer vegetables only because meat tastes better than veggies; People would like to go somewhere by car which is quite close to their house instead of by foot only because it is more "convienent". Seriously, we really have to do something to help to make improvements. As what professor has mentioned in the lecture, many people do have cognition of how severe the climate issues are. Nevertheless, they refuse to take any action. It is absolutely worthless and making no sense.

It’s pretty exciting after hearing all one can do to help the climate and realize you’re already doing most of them. At the same time though, a lot of these aren’t done by choice as college students. Due to financial factors, it’s pretty easy to follow all of these things and help the planet. The trouble with living in America is that one always wants to be better off than one another and be able to show off how well one is doing by their tangible prizes such as houses, cars, and other luxuries. Besides greed, some people want to show off for deeper reasons. For example, the minorities that have parents set on this dream of their children having a certain future may have more of a push towards tangible goods in order to show their culture and family that they’re doing well. This can also be seen as greed though, as one who is educated to do the right thing should in that case be able to do the right things and follow through with no attachments to personal preferences. 
 <br><br>
I think this is what bothers most Americans as well. They’re so set on their idea of freedom and being able to do whatever they want that being told they have to slightly change their way of living is way too out of hand - even if it means putting the climate of this world at risk. 
 <br><br>
Hopefully this generation is the one to value environmental factors over political and societal factors and are able to fix the mistakes in order for the sake and sanity of the generations to come.

I also felt a sense of relief after Professor Hiltner listed 5 things we, as Americans, can do to reduce our carbon footprint. I agree that Americans constantly want and want as a way to reach this unattainable goal of the American Dream: which currently just promotes a consumer society that has no regard to the livelihood of our planet. Often, those who don’t “believe in” anthropogenic climate change are conservative politically. My point in this statement is that those who want freedom and to not be forced to regress as a society while reducing our carbon footprint, although this is far from true, are also against women being able to choose what to do with their bodies and/or putting hardworking human beings in cages and tearing families apart if an immigrant doesn’t have a paper saying they are a member of this magical “land of the free.” This hypocrisy is baffling and sadly a tragic reality of American society. I agree with Angela that a lot of American’s lack the ability to slightly change any aspect of their life, even if it will have tremendous benefits for our environment.

I find it funny how accurate Ken's depictions of each generation are. Just like he said, I watched this video and thought to myself, "that's very easy!" However, I know that older family members would be outright offended, screaming about freedoms and natural rights. I also find it funny how people can get offended by this when it is merely a suggestion. There will probably never be a law that limits how many clothes you can buy or how much meat you can eat, yet older generations instantly feel threatened when the thought of giving this up is brought up. Gladly, I feel that my generation and myself are more open to the idea of giving up certain things to live a more eco-friendly lifestyle. This can be seen in the huge wave of thrift shopping, veganism, minimalism, and more. The best part about it all is that these things are viewed in a very positive light. People are often respected for going "smaller." This is in direct contrast to America's "bigger is better" motto. 
 <br><br>

This video leaves me a little more optimistic than before I watched. The 5 things Ken listed -- giving up your car, living in shared living spaces, moving towards a plant-based diet, limiting children to 2 or less, and buying less consumer goods -- seems like something that my generation can do. Of course there will always be people who want it all, but I believe in the vast majority of people. I believe that we can live simpler lives if it means saving the Earth.

When watching Ken's lecture I thought as well that it was very funny how accurate Ken was. I feel like it is easier for our generation to follow the things that ken points out in this video because climate crisis is something that we were born into, therefore we are more inclined to do things to help since it is what we have been doing our whole lives. I think that also it has to do with the idea of helping the planet is very trendy now a days and is seen as something good. For example, like Ken mentions a way that we can help the crisis is by buying clothes from thrift shops. For people in our generation this is something that we do even without thinking about the climate crisis, since currently dressing in vintage clothes is something that is super trendy. However, if you were to tell older generations such as Ken's to dress in used clothing, most people would think that it is outrageous for someone to expect them to dress in other people's discarded clothing.
 <br><br>
To answer Ken's question, yes and no. I do think that our generation is able to change their habits and help the planet, which is clearly something that the previous generation was unable to do. However, I do not think that it is possible for our generation to fix the problem that previous generations caused. I think that in order to fix or greatly improve our current situation every individual should do their part to contribute, it is not possible to do this with just one generation.


<br><hr>
I agree with you that these life changes seem much easier for our generation than to our parents’ generation. My friends and I have made many of these changes as our lives progress and as we keep gaining more knowledge about the climate crisis. I have even seen the prevalence of more minimalists in my life and am inspired to convert to a more minimalist lifestyle. Living in the dorms with such a small amount of living space almost forces you into minimalism, but I plan to keep the ‘minimal’ lifestyle that I have built in Santa Barbara even after college.
 <br><br>

As Ken said, these life changes almost seem appealing, especially the city living. The younger generation has more respect for these changes and probably seems easier because our life is constantly changing and moving around anyways. These changes are more difficult for the older generation to accept because they are already ‘settled down’ and don’t find change or lack of security appealing. 
 <br><br>

I have made an effort to convince my parents to also make life changes and luckily they have respected my suggestions. It is almost astonishing how much a car and a house add to our carbon footprints and how easy it is to trade out those ‘necessities’ with other options like biking or public transportation. 
 <br><br>

Minimalism and reducing my carbon footprint is now at the top of my bucket list.
<br><hr>
I had a similar response; I too imagine adopting an eco-conscious lifestyle sounds fairly easy and have already integrated many of his suggestions into my current life, as well as in my plans for the future. Some suggestions are easier than others, especially for the older generations that have settled into their ways of transport, housing, eating, and shopping. It was interesting that Ken noted the reaction of the older generations as actually “recoiling from change”, and as you mention, feeling threatened by the prospect of relinquishing their lifestyle.
 <br><br>

I believe this is due to the fact that most older generations have been established; they’ve followed society’s recipe for mediocre success and acquired their prizes. The prospect of giving up what they feel they have earned is the catalyst of such aversion to change. The benefit of being young is that we are not yet established. What we do possess is either minimal, or under the ownership of our parents/ guardians. Therefore it is easier to build ideas and lifestyles upon a relatively clear foundation rather tearing an existing one down to rebuild as the older generations would have to do. 
 <br><br>

However, as a generation, we are somewhat ignorant of our own addictions, namely to convenience. We have been raised in a world of instant result and gratification where at the tap of a button on a screen or a short drive to a store, we can procure massive amounts of unnecessary things. Breaking these habits sounds easy, though is much more challenging in practice. For instance, my roommate recently had take-out food driven and delivered to our room from a restaurant that is a 10-minute walk away; When this small convenience is adopted by millions of people, the effects are large.
 <br><br>

Ultimately, Ken is completely correct in that we, and the generations that follow us, are the hope for the planet’s well-being. By creating a culture of eco-consciousness and taking these suggestions to heart, change seems attainable. I too feel more optimistic than before.
<br><hr>
I like what you had to say about our generation! I agree we are more likely to consider making changes to “go smaller” vs. “bigger is better”. More people from our generation are realizing that if we don’t make changes, we will suffer later, our kids will suffer in their lifetimes, their kids may not even make it. Just like procrastination--once you realize you are seriously running out of time you actually start to do the work, I feel like this is where we are at now with climate change but generally only the younger generation realizes it. I wanted to address the five suggestions Ken made. 
 <br><br>


1. Giving up your car: Definitely doable IF you are in an area that can support public transportation. However, hard for some people depending on job, circumstances, etc. I would rate it a 5/10 (how easy this is to do).

 <br><br>

2. Living in shared spaces: Again, easy if you are a college student but further down the line many people don’t want more than their family in a house 3/10.

 <br><br>

3. Moving towards a plant-based diet: VERY EASY for middle class and up, especially in a place like California. There are so many great tasting alternatives and restaurants almost always make accommodations 8/10.

 <br><br>

4. Limiting children to 2 or less: Pretty easy unless religious reasons/ desire to have more? (maybe?) 9/10.

 <br><br>

5. Buying less consumer goods: Definitely pretty easy for some (some can’t even support buying consumer goods willy nilly, they have to budget). However, others who live a more privileged lifestyle can find this very difficult because they live their life where they place great value on items like gucci belts and brand name clothing, etc.

Both of the generational lectures for this week stuck with me in a way previous lectures didn’t. The distinctions between the two generations made it clear. We (the current generation) need to take action. It was promising hearing responses of people from my generation towards the 5 actions Ken suggested for reducing our carbon footprint. However, it was painful to hear the responses of his generation. The responses described reminded me of comments from “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming.” They related to the American concept of freedom, and how that relates to climate change. (Which was a similar argument taken upon in the article). It reminded me all too much of America’s history of taking things which don’t belong to them. The argument that we should be able to needlessly consume directly correlates to other times in history, such as justifications for slavery, for removal of Native American land and people, and many other aspects of America. It left me dismayed to see that almost a whole generation is still in the old American mindset that you should be able to have or take whatever you want. 
 <br><br>

However, I do have an anecdote that left me feeling a bit more hopeful about past generations, and I hope it will do the same for you:  I am currently working as a caregiver/nurse for the elderly. My clients are usually aged 75-95, so one would assume them to not be too worried about climate change. Yesterday I was with a client and somehow the discussion of California fires came up. This lovely elderly woman turned to me while we were discussing it, and goes: "Well, if we don't do anything, climate change is going to get worse, and these fires are going to get worse." Let's just say the rest of my shift was spent discussing climate change with her. She spoke with me about how she reuses everything in her house, limits her carbon footprint as much as possible, and is even a member of the Women's Voting Club here in Santa Barbara. She attends conferences (when she is able to, she has trouble getting around) where she speaks about how to lessen our CO2 footprints. I then shared all the articles from our Eng 23 course with her, and we had a wonderful discussion. If this woman (who can't even get around on her own) is an activist for preventing climate change, anyone can be.

I loved reading about your client’s dedication to activism even at her age and ability level! My grandmother gives me similar hope. For as long as I’ve known her, my grandmother has expressed a similar outlook on life as what Ken described many baby boomers to have - I earned what I have, so I deserve as much as I can buy with it. However, I have always admired her willingness to listen to new perspectives, as she did with me as I grew up and became increasingly interested in living a more sustainable lifestyle. She was fascinated to learn that I shop secondhand and carry reusable cutlery with me everywhere, and that my dream house is actually not a house at all, but more of a spacious apartment. As I came to visit, soon SHE was the one sharing new articles about sustainable living and the climate crisis with me, and sharing the small improvements she was making to her own lifestyle. 
 <br><br>
It’s impossible to convince everyone in the older generations that making the 5 changes Ken explained are not only possible but even attractive options, but I believe that we all have the ability to influence change by leading as an example.

<p>
Finally, a course of action that can help mitigate the climate crisis on a personal level. Thank you. I have shared this video with a few of my friends to the “huh”s and “ha”s that I had no idea how to respond to. I have recently shifted my diet towards a vegan diet, in large part for the benefits of my own health and have felt great about it. Many people my age will ask me why and I try to tell them why without being snobby or superior. And it’s difficult. People have a preconceived notion that if you call yourself a vegan, you think you’re superior to other people and that is just not the message that anyone wants to hear. So I try and direct it towards little steps that people can do, like moving to meatless mondays and then going without beef. From then, cutting out meat and going vegetarian. And so on. With each step, there is a significant reduction in carbon footprint and if one must put their foot down and say, “I can never give up fish” or “I could never give up eggs or cheese”, if they go any bit towards a plant-based diet at all, they make a relatively significant impact. And for a crisis like climate change sacrifices must be made by those largely contributing. Those who can or are willing to sacrifice more, should and those who refuse to or can only sacrifice a little, should as well. 
 <br><br>
Regarding the consumption of stuff, another of those difficult things is the incessant feeling of need to have more. But what if we moved from wanting more to wanting better. Instead of buying 100 2$ toothbrushes that last a month and then must be thrown away or thousands of plastic bags at the grocery store that will never see more than 2 uses, we invested a little more into quality things that are sustainable or biodegradable or will last 20 times more uses than the cheap stuff. In the long term, it is these that save the most money, and help reduce the impact that we have on the planet. On the other hand, buying second hand clothes instead of buying the newest shirt or pants or whatever that demands the over production of carbon in the atmosphere is fortunately coming into style and should be a first stop for those who “need” new.
 <br><br>
It’s unfortunate and disappointing that we live in a country that values stuff over the wellbeing of their own children.

Getting solutions to our climate problem at hand is great. I love that Ken layed out for us these five things that we can do locally to immensely help our planet globally. The issue that I have with some of these are that there are systems in place to prevent us from doing these easily. Not only that but the stigma around these impacts us as well. Take transportation for example. If public transportation was cleaner, cheaper, and more accessible run times then it would be easier for people to make the switch. Some buses don’t run 24/7 or even early in the morning / late at night so for some people taking public transportation isn’t really an option. Also a large amount of people have a poor opinion on public transportation so they wouldn't be caught dead on one. If we changed our opinion on public transportation and gave it a makeover to fix some issues I think that we could totally start leaning away from vehicles as much. 
 <br><br>
With housing, people like to have big houses because it shows that they have a lot of money and well bigger is better right? Wrong. What’s the point in having such a huge house when you don’t even use a majority of the rooms in it? This toxic idea that having bigger and better things make you a cooler and special person needs to be cut out now. It doesn’t matter what you have, what matters is how you treat yourself, others, and the planet. And that big ol house of yours contributing to the climate problem! 
 <br><br>
We waste so much food!  Thousands of people are going hungry each day in the United States alone while we just waste ⅓ to a ½ of our food. I went vegan almost two years ago and it was very difficult. My choices for food was limited, more expensive, and not always accessible. I had to learn how to portion my food and cook it correctly, and I found that I started wasting less food. And this is just one of the many things that comes with eating a more plant based diet. If we could make plant based alternatives more available locationally and financially, as well as educate people on how to cook it, we would see a significant amount of people switching to more plant based diets. 
 <br><br>
Luckily having a few or no kids has become a more normalized thing. But there is still this thought that the main purpose in life is to have a bunch kids so that way they can take care of you when you’re old and take over your things when you die. Hundreds of years ago this is what we needed to survive. You had more protection in numbers against other communities and species that were trying to attack you, and you had people to leave your legacy and family name to. Even decades ago people were having children so they could have more financially security by sending their children to work - before the child labor laws. And there are so many other reasons that people could think we need to have so many children. But this isn’t the case anymore. We are more developed and we simply don’t need that many people, and we have to take our carrying capacity into account. 
 <br><br>
Our consumption problem is frightening to say the least. We have been conditioned to think that buying things will make us feel better or look cooler and make us happier. So misguided. We need to switch our mentality and our products. We need to realize that our things don’t make us happy, experiences and people we love are what make us happy. We have to make upcycling and thrift stores more normalized. We need to stop giving our money to these companies who are selling us products at the expensive of abused people and nature. We don’t need people working in sweatshops to make our Urban Outfitters clothes. We don’t need to be abusing our resources by making products that everyone throws away once it’s not fashionable or cool. We need products that are durable and meant to last that are environmentally conscious and sustainable. Then we can still enjoy our things, but not at the expense of the health of all species and the earth.

After watching this week’s lectures, I started to think of all the different ways our generation has already strided towards making changes for the climate crisis. Gen Z and millennials have significantly more vegetarians and vegans compared to older generations. The amount of vegans has grown exponentially in the past decade. There is a whole social movement encouraging young people to cast their ballot for sustainable policies. Plus, there are more and more electric, hydro, etc cars in the roads, and we see more and more people carry reusable straws or cafes with paper straws. Additionally, people are more aware about the dangers of fast fashion, and many young people are turning to up-sales or thrifting. Although our generation can’t single-handedly dismantle the systems that big industries such as fossil fuel or beef industries have already established in power, nor reverse the damage caused by previous generations living in first world countries, we have made movements in wanting to make changes for the better. I think that if (unrealistically) we all had accessible education and resources, our generation can greatly reduce greenhouse emissions.

I agree with many of the points that you have made in your comment. You are absolutely right about our generation being the ones that are doing more than the older generation in regard to taking steps to reduce our carbon footprint. For instance, through popular trends it is popular to use paper straws or to carry around metal straws, which helps keep our oceans cleaner and to reduce plastic use. Large chains, such as Starbucks, have replaced their plastic straws with sippy cup lids in an effort to reduce how many plastic straws are used. In recent years, the most popular trend within the youth has been hydroflasks and other reusable water bottles, and it is much more likely to see a hydroflask on a college campus than a plastic water bottle. I agree with your point that our generation also has significantly more vegans and vegetarians than any other generation. Most of my friends don't even go to the mall anymore and instead buy their clothes from thrift stores. 
 <br><br>
If we were able to inform the older generations about the consequences of using plastic straws, plastic straws, and eating meat on a daily basis and they changed their lifestyle just a little bit, it would make a great difference. If we were to simply talk to our parents and grandparents about these alternatives we could possibly convert a few. Personally, out of the five things that Ken said we can do to help the environment there are some that we can start doing right now. If we were to just start off trying to go vegetarian by not having meat one meal a day, and walking or taking public transportation to places that we want to go, we can decrease our carbon footprint. There are simple changes that we need to make that can cause a significant change for the better.

I think it is very interesting that Ken mentions one way in which people can help fight the climate crisis is to move to a large city. When I first heard this, I thought to myself-- isn't that counterintuitive? Shouldn't you move to the countryside and live a life away from the big city where large corporations thrive? However, I can see that his points made a lot of sense-- it is much easier to get around by way of public transportation and  bikes then cars in the cities and houses are smaller and more efficient.

 <br><br>

 I think many of the things he mentions are very doable. It all boils down to buying less and wasting less/ not wasting at all. However, I can see how people can be stubborn to change. Asking someone to ditch their car, wear used clothing, only eat lentils for dinner, etc. can almost sound like asking them to lower their standard of living in a way. People want bigger, newer, better things-- especially if they've worked very hard for these things. To ask people-- especially the older generation -- to change their way of living is a huge, almost impossible task.

In the lecture video "Can on generation do what previous generations failed to do?", Professor Hitner gives us 5 possible solutions to reduce carbon footprint and mitigate the climate crisis. Although these little changes sound easy, it is very difficult to accomplish because most people are not willing to change their current lifestyle. As professor Hitner mentioned in his video, most Americans are not willing to live in tiny houses because they think they deserve better housing as they earn everything through their hard work. Even though the climate crisis is imminent, many people still accept hedonism because enjoying what they earn is another way to express freedom. I am kind of pessimistic about our future because most people are selfish and not willing to change their lifestyle.



</p><hr>


<p>

The takeaway from this lecture video is the five suggestions that Ken proposes which we can do it right away. I personally go along with some of them but not all of them because saying is much easier than acting and the issue is far more complicated that it can't simply be solved by following these five "simple changes" as Ken may describe it. The first one I can't agree on more is to waste less food. Food is precious and is what keeps us alive. It is shocking to hear that 2/3 of the food we purchased was wasted. And it is also impossible to imagine that a meat-based diet will put the planet into a big crisis. The simple way is to support a vegan style of living or if there has to be a need for meat, then you shouldn't waste it anyway. The next one I would nod my head is to rethink the relationship with stuff. To some extent, the notion that consumption makes you happy is accumulated through the decades and it would be very difficult to change. But I still suggest that we should take the time to re-construct our thinking like the minimalists who can live peacefully with the planet even with few materials possessions. 
 <br><br>


The other three suggestions are those that I can't totally agree on because of the intricacy of social, political and cultural problems. As Ken mentions that moving to cities could simply solve the transportation and housing issues at the same time, both of which account for 1/4 of individual carbon footprint, I suggest that moving to cities actually accelerate the expansion of cities that require more land uses and intensify the consumption issue. Let me explain. When there are more people rushing to cities, there will be a huge increase in the demand for land whether it is for housing or for firms that provide jobs. When cities need more lands, they simply just expand and expand to the extent that forests are cut for more housing and agricultural uses. Regarding having fewer kids, I find it is an appealing solution to the increasing population issue but it is way more complexed than it looks. People from the world have different ideas about having children which may due to cultural and social reasons. Some cultures prefer boys to girls and hence people insist on giving birth until they have a boy. It will be useless and unconvincing to tell them to have fewer kids because of some climate crisis that simply just weighs less than a boy in their traditions. There have to be policies. But it will also be too compelling to have one of those and too difficult to carry out.

This lecture videos make me further understand the different thinking about the old generation. The professor lists five ways to reduce the carbon footprint. Our young generation thinks they are very easy to achieve and is surprise about how the serious climate crisis is solved in such an easy way. However, the old generation thinks those five ways are not good at all. They think those methods against their work of entire life, since those five ways somehow limit their right to purchase. No one wants the restriction without obvious benefit. Therefore, the old generation refuses to sacrifice their right for the climate crisis, which will not larger affect them. The thinking of the old generation is reasonable and hard to be changed. Therefore, I wish our new generation will not repeat the old after step in society. It may seem easy for the young generation to do those five methods, keeping minimalism, but as we grow up, the perspective may be changed due to various reasons. From what I observed in the dining commons, the wastes of food are a serious problem for even the young generation. Hope our generation don’t repeat the previous generations

I learned five ways that people can do to help the environmental crisis to reduce our climate footprint. The first one is to change to be plant-based diet, because the majority of methane emission is from the meat production. If we change to be vegetarians, we are also in the way of dealing with the problem about ethnicity of animal. Changing to use public transportation instead of private cars, live in sharing house, purchasing as least as fancy clothes and live in big city. All of these combined together seems like to live as a poor worker in the city with lowest social status. This is so interesting and seems very easy to do.

It was fantastic to hear and get to know the major five things that we can do to help reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. I would say some of these are actually easier for us to make changes on but some might be a bit harder. For example, I personally agree that it is easier for us to slowly reduce the purchase of stuff that are not necessary. People now rely on the idea of materialism a lot and I understand that we all have the desire to work hard and use the money we earn to buy something we all want. But many of the ideas we have are influenced by all the ads/promotion and when we are not actually in need of those things, we still buy them simply because the ads told us to do so. Also, it is actually a great idea to use public transportation instead of driving own car to reduce greenhouse gases emission but that would only work in places where transportation is convenient.However, if when there is a choice to choose among car and public transportation, I would also encourage people to pick the one that is more environmentally friendly.I am not a vegetarian but I do think some time to choose to eat vegetables but not meat would also be a great choice which is not for our health but for the place we live as well.
 <br><br>
I would also like to comment on the other video which talks about people always say “knowledge is power” . Knowledge is a good thing, it let us learn what is good/wrong nd learn the fact of it and have our own critical thinking, but I do agree with that knowledge only become powerful when we act them out and bring them into action not simply just learn it. So, I really hope those of us learn about cli ate change will start to take action on helping to make some changes on the planet.

After watching this video and listening to Ken’s five points of how we could cut back our own carbon emissions, I felt a wave of relief. Living as a college student I have been doing all of those things to an extent. I will admit that I do still eat meat but I have been cutting back on red meat to maybe once a week if that and moving toward white meat instead. In addition, for the past ten years, I have gone to a summer camp either as a camper or a worker where they would never serve red meat, would encourage others to try vegetarian and vegan meals, and composted all of the leftover food so that it could be used to help produce the food they grow in their gardens. Seeing how these small changes to one’s lifestyle can help the environment a significant amount is amazing to me because I always believed we would have to do so much to make even a slight difference.
 <br><br>
Additionally, for so many years, my ideal life for the future was always to move away to a different city where I wouldn’t have to drive and living in a roomy apartment with a partner and maybe a cat. I never really grew up with much money so my ideal lifestyle was always just to live comfortably not lavishly. I can understand that this may not be an easy thing for other people since the entire population cannot all live in cities with decent public transportation, it’s just impossible. However, if those people who cannot live without their car or a big house, they can still cut their meat consumption, their clothing shopping, and have no more one child. By even doing three of the five things, they can still cut their emissions by about twenty-five percent which in my opinion is better than nothing especially when every single person is doing their part in cutting back emissions. I believe that knowledge is indeed power and if more people were to hear that doing even a couple of these slight changes to their lifestyles could help the planet they would. Many people, even myself before this video, feel as though they can’t do anything because they are one person but in fact, we can all make a difference no matter what.

I would definitely agree with what you have said. It is great to hear how you have been inspired by the vegetarians even though you are not one of them but your action on cutting back red meat is very great. It is definitely not easy for all of us to completely change our lifestyle as what you have said, but I do think everyone has the ability to make small changes on their own ways of living which might bring a huge impact to the place we live. 

 <br><br>

Living our life in a simple way was once actually something we all looking for but as economic/technological developed rapidly these years, we all think a life with materialism is something we want. Life is always filled with choices, we are never being forced to pick any one of them. Our decisions on pick which one and what to do with them is all up to us.

 <br><br>

Climate change is caused by human actions, outcome occurred based something we have chosen; so to save our planet we need to do something again and make wise and effective choices.

<p>

I really agree with all the solutions given by Ken in this video. Before I attend this class, just like what Ken said, I always ask “What can I do?” After I watch this video, I begin to have ideas and plan about what I should do and I realize how I can recommend people in my family to do. 
 <br><br>


To be honest, people are always selfish. To tell them to leave the big house and change into a much smaller house, to tell them to eat less meat and have more vegetables, to tell them to use fewer cars in order to prevent global warming, to prevent the issue of climate change from happening is impractical. People will only take action when their own profit is being subtracted. After deep consideration, we will find that these solutions actually can help ourselves, not only prevent climate change from happening, which influence the future but also prevent our body health. Using fewer cars means that less noxious gas will be produced, which means that the quality of air will be enhanced. People will have fewer risks of getting lung cancer. Eating more vegetables can also let people have more health nutrient balance. 

 <br><br>

This idea let me begin to consider another situation. If governments or scientists choose to propagandize the solution of climate change by advertising how useful these solutions can be to enhance the physical health, will it become more practical than telling them these can solve the climate change in the future?

I completely agree with everything you said. Indeed, man is naturally a selfish creature and thus it is natural to believe that man will want to hoard valuables with them for their own profit. However, we are not in a situation where this will lead to a positive and sustainable route. In fact, as Ranbing says, we can actually gain things from living in moderation with the climate in mind. I found it really interesting that you brought up the idea of the minimization of car usage as it seems obvious that using a vehicle that pumps out CO2 can only lead to damage, and the way it can affect immediate health such as through lung damage and not only hurt the climate is a factor that is overlooked at times. Much of what is causing climate change is already hurting the health of people as it is right now.
 <br><br>

Regarding the situation with what we can do as a generation to help combat climate change, I found the idea that we can make such a big change in our carbon footprint really surprising, funnily just like Ken hypothesized. While I regularly eat meat, I don't necessarily look down upon a more plant-based diet as it is not only healthier it is really more likely to be more accessible and affordable. Also similar to what Ken said, I believe that many people from older generations would not only reject the proposition that Ken brought up, I believe they would be disgusted at the idea of even being asked to change such a small part of their daily lives.






</span></div><hr>

<p>
In this lecture Ken starts by talking about what we can do right now to lower our carbon footprint. He gives many doable examples, like bike more, use public transportation, live in smaller space, eat less meat, have no more than 2 children per person, just to replace yourself, and lastly try to buy less, and preowned things. All of the tools that he provided the class with are very easy to follow, by simply not eating meat three days of the week, or carpooling with a friend to work or school can make all the impact. I consider myself an environmentalist, have been actively working on lowering my own carbon footprint and have been a vegetarian for over two years and am transitioning to become vegan, I only use reusable cups, utensils, straws, grocery and produce bags, and even try and bring my own glass tupperware for leftovers and togo orders. I enjoy thrifting but still struggle with being a consumer when it comes to buying clothing; this is definitely something I need to work on. But this lecture reinforced what I have been doing is good for this planet, and have made me optimistic about my choices driving me to want to make even more environmentally friendly choice. I also collected more knowledge, that will allow me to educate others on their personal choices, in order to see if they will too try and transition into a more environmentally conscious lifestyle. 
 <br><br>

 Ken then goes in to the discussion of the generational responses over the years from his suggestions. My generation has had mostly an optimistic view on these suggestions and find them quite easy to do, but the perspective of the boomers are quite different. Insead of being like my generation, the older generation’s responses tend to be how horrible it would be to give up their car, and how they have worked hard for a big house and all the things they can get from all their hard work, money, and the other response is how this “is a direct assault on American life”. Both of these responses from the Boomers make me upset, because these are not big changes, and these small changes are going towards helping the place they live on; and they will never be able to do all these things, buy their stuff, or even have their freedom, without a planet or environment to live on.




</p><hr>


<p>

After watching the lecture “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do,” I considered the differences that Ken points out in terms of the responses among the two generations. The arguments that Ken’s generation proposes directly relate to one another in the sense that they adhere to this perception of the American way of life, as Ken points out; therefore, any such changes that require an amount of sacrifice seems irrational to this older generation. Ultimately, it requires a fundamental alteration to the American way of life. To begin to change this view of action on climate change as an “assault on the American way of life” means understanding how and why we construct our lives a certain way to meet this standard of lifestyle. It includes reflecting upon the individual choices made and recognizing the privilege that many American households maintain, including the disparity of wealth within our own country, which has evidently been a great struggle.

I completely agree. Going on what Ken said about old generations counterclaim of "I worked too hard for my lifestyle, and you want me to give it up?" I understand the position; but the means of sacrificing a materialistic item is much greater than the continuation of climate crisis. It's unfortunate and sad to know that their priorities are completely wrong and they are "the adults." In a previous lecture video; Ken had also mentioned how important it is to have a child to parent conversation about the climate change. Although, this approach can be more difficult since most parent's can't seem to adapt to a new generation; but for me I at least got my parents to listen to my side. 
 <br><br>
I usually have a weekly phone call with my parents on Tuesday's; and they had asked me how my classes were going and I remembered about the child to parent conversation so I did exactly that. I took that opportunity to inform my parents all the same information I've been learning with the class. Being of the Mexican culture; meat is in our everyday dietary and my mom had mentioned out she tried to go vegetarian when she was younger but her mom wouldn't allow it. So she told me that if I was to decide to go vegetarian then, she would be in full support especially after informing her about the meat industry and how much damage that can cause. It's just sad to know that my grama doesn't agree with my point of view and finds this entire thing ridiculous, but hopefully one day I can change her mind.






</span></div><hr>

<p>
I feel that the points Ken laid out in this video are good and would likely help a lot.  However, I also feel as if several of them are impractical.  For example, the idea of all moving to a city or metropolitan area sounds nice, but is impractical when considering the sheer number of people who would need to move and the new housing and streets that would need to be built.  Most major areas are already well over their population saturation level.  Also, many people do not have the capital to live closer to a major city.  I went on Zillow for San Francisco recently, and the cheapest option for a studio apartment was approximately 1900 dollars a month to rent, which is prohibitively expensive for a majority of Americans.  
 <br><br>


A second point that may seem impractical is the idea of people trading in their cars for public transit systems.  After all, when you do not have the money to live in the city, you need a way to get there and public transportation does not tend to extend everywhere in every city.  However, I believe this solution is not only worth pursuing, but also achievable.  I just spent 6 months in Sweden, and their public transportation system is superb.  Every city and small town had multiple bus stops and at least one train system.  At worst, there was always a public option within a quarter mile of wherever you were.  Furthermore, the government subsidized the public transportation, so that the prices were cheaper and everyone had access to public transportation, even in a region where it may not be economically viable.  Lastly, there was an app that helped you get from point A to point B, regardless of which train companies you were using or what your ultimate destination was.  This system highlighted to me the benefits of public transportation.  Though it would be expensive to set everything up at the beginning, the benefits would be immense.  Much like installing solar panels, the longer you have them the more you save.  Except in this case, we would be helping save the planet, rather than just our money.



</p><hr>


<p>
Surprisingly, I found that I am already on the way of mitigating climate change after watching these videos. I had no cars and no plan for buying one in the near future. Public transportation and walk are all my options when going out. Besides, I do not want any child; Every time I want to buy something, I will ask myself a question: "Do you really need this?" It seems that I already done three steps among the two. I am proud and glad that I actually do something useful to the Earth and I will continue doing more in the future.

 <br><br>

However, I found it interesting that the generation before in my country are different from, or even converse to what mentions in the video. I believe the reason is the discrepancy of grow-up environment. For example, the generation of my parents, especially my grandparents experienced a harsh time: people were starving and poor. Younger children wore the clothes of their elder brothers and sisters because families cannot afford buying new clothes. Wasting food is almost a crime at that time. Hence, the quality of conserving every resources passed to now. Though they live a much better life and can afford things they want, they still used to saving money rather than consuming useless staff. Perhaps the difficult time made them value the good life now even more because they know how much efforts needed to be done in order to make such accomplishment.
 <br><br>


Ironically, I found that some of my generation are addicted to materialism and waste money. The wealthy environment allow them gain everything they want without paying cost. When obtaining becomes so easily, people won't cherish the thing they have. There is a polarization in my generation: while some are fully aware of the seriousness of climate crisis and start changing lifestyles in order to protect the planet, others are doing the opposite, that is, making things worse. From my perspective, environmental friendly lifestyle is not mean going against pursuing freedom, it is just a different choice based on different belief. Actually, it is worthy to give up what you own, such as a huge house or luxury products, since you will get something more essential in return.

<p>
In the first lecture, “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?”, truly began to make me think of how much I could have cut back in these past couple years to reduce my carbon footprint. In all honesty I have not been exposed to the climate crisis in an intellectual way until I took the class before this, English 23. It is an issue that nobody really decided to talk to me about, or something I really pushed myself to learn about since I was unaware of it’s severities. Not until this year was I presented with all the discouraging facts and harsh realities about climate change. At first I knew ways to help were by voting and by activism, but besides that I was not really sure what else to do. Thankfully, by taking this course I was shown how much I can do as an individual which gave me hope that cannot properly be expressed with words. The five things that Ken listed in this video to help cut my own carbon footprint in half is something I have learned in this class and willing to do. Although excited to change up my lifestyle I must not lie that the first two, transportation and housing, is something that will certainly be hard for me. As I am not much of a city person and appreciate my space whether it be in a car, or house. The most unfortunate thing is that by making these changes I would be able to cut as much as ½ my carbon footprint simply by the first two ways. It will be something I must think about and hopefully be willing to do as a move on from college in the near future. As for the final three those are things I will be starting to do as of now. I believe I have a lot more control of my diet, child count, and the things I buy. In my opinion those three are rather simple and can be done by me with no second thought. As Ken made an excellent point that these final three are interconnected and important to reducing our climate crisis. The three are interconnected by population to consumption ratios and if clearly thought about makes perfect sense of how this will help save our environment. As Ken explained, and as one can expect, when mentioning these five ways to cut carbon footprints of the individual in half he typically gets two responses. Students who in theory do not have much yet, know that they can live this lifestyle as they have not necessarily made too many huge lifetime decisions yet. As for the older generations struggle with this concept much more as they are already living their life and would be rather difficult to make this dramatic change. A change like this will most likely not happen unless some dramatic crisis affects them and that is just the harsh reality to it. That makes it even more urgent for those who are willing to make a change begin with themselves and begin now.

After watching this lecture, it made me realize that greed seems to be the true cause of the crisis. Its greed that allows corporations and powerful officials to prioritize profits over the environment. Greed was the reason why we first started using fossil fuels to power our economy, and now we need to overcome our greed in order to fight the crisis. Like Ken says, our consumer culture is a major factor in the climate crisis, and need to cut back on the things that make us happy and comfortable in the moment, for the sake of having a place to live in the future. We need to keep in mind that it's not just us who inhabit this planet, but plants and animals, and in the future, our kids and grand-kids depend on us to keep our home inhabitable.

That being said, I feel like our generation as a whole is not yet ready to give up their large homes, juicy steaks, and fancy clothes. While we may be on board with cutting down on CO2 usage in ways such as voting and biking, when it comes to material things, a big part of our comfort will be taken away. I too, am guilty of having this mindset. While I don't mind living in an apartment and eating less steak, driving is drastically more convenient in my suburban hometown, where public transportation is scarce and everything is far from each-other. To have everyone accomplish all 5 of Ken's suggestions is extremely unrealistic, but I can see major steps in the right direction if everyone takes at least one to heart. 

 <br><br>

In the future, I hope technology will be developed that can replace fossil fuels as the core of our economy, and we move to something environmentally friendly. In this perfect world, we can keep both our comfortable lives and our planet. However, it's unfair to pin all of our hopes on researchers and scientists. We need to make our own contributions in restoring the environment, starting with small sacrifices that will make a big difference.

The capitalist mindset that “bigger is better” is definitely the reason that I feel the need to buy new things all the time. Like you said, I am guilty of this mindset as well. In our society, it is difficult to feel secure in having a small amount of things, when I feel so much pressure to have a large wardrobe of the trendiest clothes and every new Apple product that comes out. I find a lot of this consumer attitude comes out when critiquing celebrities. A lot of them are in a double bind where they can either live sustainably and get made fun of for using commercial airlines or wearing an outfit twice, or, they can be judged for their private jets and huge closets being unsustainable. Not only must our generation make some personal sacrifices for sustainability, but we must publicly promote these ideas, and try to change the discourse around spending habits and the expectation that the more money you have, the more stuff you should have.

In this video, Professor Hiltner gave some sincere advice in reducing our carbon footprints to save the earth, or in other words, to mitigate the climate crisis. However, I felt a slight sense of helplessness after watching this video, as I realized how hard it must be for me, and possibly, for everyone else, to actually willing to take those actions and continuously carrying out those actions. As humans, our greediness is just an endless tunnel, with so many dire desires that we acne and thirst to fulfill every day. Bigger houses, expensive cars, delicious meals. Hearing about this advice is useful, but I felt so weak and hopeless in the sense that is there really going to be any changes? Are we wise enough to recognize the severe situation going on in today’s world? Are we decisive enough to realize that actions must be taken right now? Are we brave enough to give up our currently carbon-rich lifestyles into green ones that perhaps only holds minimal enjoyment? It is sad to see that people are always narrow-minded. They tend to only focus on the results in the short term, without considering the benefits in the long term. For example, it might be hard to go on to a plant-based diet, but it will make our bodies healthier and will reduce the cases of obesity. In addition, it might be hard to utilize public transportation on an everyday basis, but it will reduce our carbon dioxide intake and eventually leading to fewer cases of respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. It is just way too easy to only see the short term loss and ignore the long term outcomes. I sincerely hope that we could all extend our eyesight into the future, and do not later regret our failure to take action right now.

I have been a vegetarian for most of my life; this year will be one decade of a meat-free diet. As a third grader, I randomly made the decision to become a vegetarian, and up until a couple years ago, I would never have an answer to the question of why. Before knowing the immense negative impacts of the meat industry, I would always tell people that it was a random choice I made as an 8-year-old and I decided to stick with for no apparent reason. After learning of these environmental impacts, I now have a substantial reason: vegetarianism is a critical way to reduce one’s carbon footprint. Now, whenever someone finds out that I don’t eat meat and questions my reasoning, I explain that it benefits the environment in countless ways, hopefully encouraging them to do the same and make a dietary switch. Given that I made this decision a long time ago, I don’t really remember having a problem adapting to a vegetarian diet, however, I recognize the challenge it poses to many other people my age and older. To drastically switch one’s diet takes a lot of effort, but that shouldn’t be an excuse not to do so; vegetarianism is a simple, painless way to reduce individual carbon footprints and it would be vital in the process of healing our planet. 
 <br><br>

While my diet is already largely plant-based, I do eventually want to make the switch to veganism. However, eating in the dining halls has not made this easy; while vegan options exist, there is little variation and it becomes repetitive. Through this experience, I’ve realized the importance of both accessibility and quality vegetarian/vegan foods. I believe that it would be much easier for anyone to change their diet (whether it’s to plant-based or not) if they’re given the perfect set-up. Humans tend to stray away from things that cause too much of an inconvenience to them, so if vegetarian or vegan options were more widely accessible and appealing to everyone, the switch would be much less of a hassle. Although there are many other things that individuals can do to reduce their carbon footprint, switching to a plant-based diet can be a straightforward and very impactful way to actively make a difference.

While I strongly agree with your comment, I must play devil's advocate here. While I care for the environment greatly, I don't think that it is possible for everyone to give up meat. While I respect those that are able to make the change to a more "green" diet, I myself would struggle greatly with this change. I eat meat at every meal, and simply cannot feel full off of just a salad. However, I don't think it's necessary for everyone to make all the changes listed, or at least to the same degree that feels implied in the video. In Ken's YouTube lecture, some of the changes may come off as extreme such as getting rid of your car, radically changing your diet, or switching to a smaller house that could be 1/16 the size of your last one. I feel like I understand why some people were taken aback by this proposal, but they don't understand that the message in between the lines that follows after each suggestion is "to the best of your ability". You don't have to move into hostel-like living conditions to make the change. You could only eat red meat on nights out, or drive your car less, or buy a house that fits your needs and belongings, but no more. While it would certainly help the environment a lot more to make all the changes listed to the fullest possible extent, this isn't realistic. While real change needs to happen at the level of the consumerism and fossil fuel industries, this doesn't mean that we the people can't lead the way in environmental change.

The situation is not optimistic now, so everyone needs to make a change in daily life. Because of the present consummerism, many people start to pursue bigger objects. To them, bigger is equal to better. For example, they buy bigger houses and use phones with larger screens. But what can we do? Ken offered us methods in 5 regions: transportation; housing; waste less food; bore fewer children; fix relationship to items. I feel really shamed about "waste less food". I sometimes dump the food when it tastes strange to me. After realizing that wasting food produces a lot of carbon dioxide, I decided to change my behavior. Next time I will only choose what I like. In addition, Ken mentioned the different responses from younger and older generations. What the older generation think really dispairs me. They are unwilling to change their living styles and consider such idea as horrible. What really is scary is that they believe the idea of changing as a threaten to their freedom. As a result, we, the younger generation, should contribute more. We need to not only change our own behaviors, but also try to persuade the elders. In general, use less, waste less, and buy less will create a bright future for the whole human society.

In Ken's lecture, he mentioned that most old generations are unlikely to make a difference since it is hard for them to give up their possessions or change the wasteful lifestyle. Instead, young people are just at the starting point of their own lives and they can take action right now to influence others positively. Thus, the younger generation can do more significant contribution to save the earth. I agree with you that wasting food is disappointed and people must realize the severity of climate change since food production utilizes a lot of fossil fuels and produces much greenhouse gas. Also, people are crazy about consuming clothes because of the encouragement of unreasonable advertisements and incorrect social values. In fact, those negative actions that deteriorate the environment should be avoided. In order to take action in five areas which Ken stated, the younger generation should use public transportation, move in more efficient houses, and eat or waste less meat. In this way, we can expect a better future for our planet.

In the first lecture, “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?”,  I considered most of the material to be very informative for the audience at the beginning. Hiltner proposes 5 simple things that anyone can do to reduce their climate footprint. These five things revolved around transportation, housing, food, population, and relationship with materialistic things. He noted that some of these things were related in some way to make things easier. For example, moving to the city, would allow one to take both the transportation and housing approach, by moving to a micro apartment while also commuting to work. He stated that by making those five lifestyle changes, one may cut their climate footprint in half, or perhaps a quarter of its present size. Hiltner then goes on to talk about generational responses about the five lifestyle changes that he proposed. The current generation, my generation, didn’t seem to have a problem with that proposal, if anything they found it “exciting, even desirable”. On the contrary, Hiltner’s generation opposed greatly on the thought of making such a change. His generation claimed to feel like they were losing their freedoms. What’s special about Hiltner’s generation is that though they were taught by past generations, as any other generation, his generation managed to do something different, and that was by innovating and drastically oversizing their lifestyles which would eventually lead to disastrous effects for our planet. But even then, I can’t say that our generation hasn’t been influenced by Hiltner’s for the worst. 
 <br><br>
In the second lecture, Hiltner explains why his generation, the “Boomer generation”, knew all along about the climate crisis. Hiltner says that his generation say it coming. At first, I disagreed with him until he clarified that they didn’t specifically know about climate change, but they did know that if they continued their excessive use of fossil fuels, it would take a drastic turn for the worst. They knew that the two principal greenhouses were carbon dioxide and methane. Carbon dioxide primarily comes from everything, because everything we do revolves around burning fossil fuels. A physicist published an article entitled “The Carbon Dioxide Theory of Climate Change” which talked about how the result of burning fossil fuels was an increase in global temperatures. This is coming from a physicist. This should prove a point that climate change isn’t some myth that tree huggers made up. It’s real, and it’s already headed for the worst. Even the oil companies knew about the inevitable dangers in the 1970’s, which shouldn’t come as a surprise. 
 <br><br>
One thing that Hiltner said that stuck to me and that I completely agree with is that knowledge isn’t power, but acted upon knowledge is power. If there’s anything important about the lecture that I learned, it’s that.

In Ken's lecture "Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?" Ken lists five ways in which we can reduce our carbon footprint. These ways include, using your car less or switching to mass transit, a plant-based diet, having a smaller home, having only one child per person and to make sure that what you are going to buy is something you actually need and not something you want. All of these reasons seem pretty reasonable in my opinion. At the moment, I satisfy all of these. A year ago, the plant-based diet would have been hard for me to satisfy because my family loves meat. Since, I have came to UCSB I find myself eating salads at least once a day and even when I do not I don't reach for meat. Doing this has also provided a lot of health benefits for me because I now find myself wanting to be more active and go with my friends to the rec cen to work out which is something I never did before. I feel like people do not tend to believe resorting to these ways can do anything because they feel that one single person cannot reverse the effects of climate change. They fail to understand that if enough people were to adapt these ways into their daily lives than it would make a huge difference in the effects of climate change. Climate change is mainly caused by the amount of CO2 we put into the atmosphere and in the video, housing and transportation together make up about 1/2 of our carbon footprint which would make a difference if enough people were to adapt them and these are just two of the five things that people should do to reduce their carbon footprint. Ken says that his generation may find these unreasonable. It is very upsetting that the older generation may find these way unreasonable, but that this crisis escalated during their lifetime. They are not completely to blame however, because the climate change has worsened even with the emergence of this newer generation. Nevertheless, action must be taken now because we do not have enough time for another generation to pass by and have done nothing to combat climate change. In Ken's lecture "What the boomer generation knew about the climate crisis -  and when we knew it" Ken states "if acted upon, knowledge is power". This quote shows how the previous generation did not have power because they knew that the climate was worsening but did not act upon it and now we have to act. I feel that now we must act because we do not have any other choice in stopping climate change because this crisis will just worsen and we will continue to destroy our planet and lead it to becoming uninhabitable.

Ultimately, I feel like if more people become more conscious of their daily consumption habits, there can be some kind of change or progress. Taking this class holds me accountable for my habits. It's definitely made me think twice before treating myself. I am also confident that our generation is making a movement towards more sustainable lifestyles or shopping habits. One example brought up in the view was thrift shopping. I feel like many people my age have begun to see thrift stores as an excellent option for finding unique pieces of clothing, without having to give in to the fast fashion industry. However, the only problem I see there is that much of the clothing in those stores are meant for those who can't afford to buy newer clothes. I am also interested in the movement for more micro-housing and am interested in moving to city when I leave college. Overall, I do see the youth beginning to become more aware of their carbon footprint and holding producers more accountable. I only hope that it is enough to save us from oncoming disaster.

In a perfect world all five of these Earth saving tips would be ideal. I found myself thinking that some of these tips seemed too much to actually live comfortably and sustainable or is that just me being selfish? The whole climate change problem and solution seems like one big circle. While cutting out car use would make a huge difference, many changes to the city would need to be made. Unlike Santa Barbara, riding a bike can be very unsafe as it is not as common route of transportation. The city and the population would need to pay but considering how many people lack interest in making a change already , this would be a problem. My carbon footprint has definitely gone down greatly since I've been here, but that is just the norm on college campus in a wealthier place. While Santa Barbara has the nicest bike paths and water bottle filling stations, what can be done in lower income cities to help reduce climate change?  I feel if change wants be seen amongst the regular population the city and government need to step in and contribute to those who might not have a choice to change their way of life.
 <br><br>
Before coming UCSB, I honestly never considered changing the way I lived my life even though it was leaving a big footprint alone. Now I can go weeks without eating meat and sometimes I don't even notice. With all of my friends being vegan of vegetarian as well as majority of the students here it made me rethink and almost feel guilty. Saying I got peer pressured to change my diet sounds bad but it worked. If we want Ken's five tips to reduce our carbon footprint, make it a trend. We have already seen this in shopping at thrift stores and using reusable water bottles. I feel the biggest obstacle in front of change is ego. Like Ken mentioned America feels like bigger is better and associated with being more wealthy as seen with the growing square foot on houses. This is doing nothing but harming us and for what? My personal story came as a reality check rather ego. If we want change we need to be the ones that start it.

In the lecture, “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?” I felt this distinction between the two generations gives me a sense of hope regarding our ability to help save the planet. As professor Hiltner pointed out our generation responds more positively to individual steps that can be taken to help reduce CO2 emissions. I have personally noticed in increase in the popularity of the five suggestions given. Many of these steps I would consider to be new “trends” that can be seen on various social media platforms like Instagram and YouTube. Trends like veganism and minimalism have become more popular thanks to social media and influencers. With that said I don’t think any of these things should be considered trends but rather life style changes. As someone who has been plant based for 4 years I understand the struggle to make such a transition. Something that really helped me was doing more research about it. I think the more you know about all of the suggestions he gave in the video the easier it is to make a life long commitment. Even just making what seems like small changes like “Meatless Mondays” makes an impact. I am optimistic that as more facts come out about the benefits of veganism, consumption, housing, and transportation the more onboard this generation is going to be. For example, recently more information is coming out about the dangers of fast fashion. One of the biggest contributors to this is H&M. Recently; H&M has tried to win back consumer trust declaring they are looking to become more sustainable by investing in hydrothermal recycling machines. This is not in support of H&M but rather to point out how impactful our buying power can be. Another example can be seen with the dairy industry. Dairy free milk alternatives have become increasingly more popular. So much that dairy farms are following the trends and switching over to plant based options. You can read more about this on Freefromharm.org.

I agree with your comment that trends such as veganism and minimalism are quite beneficial and have the potential to reduce our carbon emissions. Habits such as eating less meat and dairy are positive habits that, in large amounts, could assist in the fight against climate change. However, I think it is important to recognize that as individuals, we can only do so much. It can be dangerous to act as though making changes in our own individual lives will save the planet because this is simply not our reality. Large corporations that burn an immense amount of fossil fuels into the atmosphere need to make changes as well. By blaming ourselves for small things, sometimes we ignore the bigger culprits. It is very common that we see articles blaming people who take long showers or eat meat for climate change when, in reality, big corporations are to blame. 
  <br><br>

I also agree with your point about H&M because one of the best things we can do is focus our attention on large corporations that contribute to global warming and climate change. Of course, doing things such as not eating meat are important and can make a difference, but we must not allow ourselves to forget about the larger powers who are influencing the climate of the glove at a way bigger scale.
<br><hr>
I agree completely. With our instant access to information, I feel that this generation has proven itself as much more environmental conscious compared to others. Younger generations are more exposed to different types and sources of information and this allows for more opinions and discussions. But it does come to the personal choices in our lives and how these choices impact our local and global environment. With increasing media exposure, environmentally friendly companies and products are being more and more popular which shows an extremely positive and almost hopeful trend.

As the consequence of climate change had already been presented and it has affected our life from various aspect, the video discusses the urgently asked question that can we do that previous generation fails to do. Ken lists several method such as substitute means of transportation, living in a micro apartment, wasting less food to reduce the production of green house gases, birth control, etc. Even though these several steps seem to contribute little to the global climate change, the power of the whole collective is unnegligible.

Having only 5 options that our generation can take at this very moment is hopeful but also worrisome because the five options are somewhat big lifestyle changes. I have adapted a few of these lifestyle changes over the years, especially because I realized my carbon footprint was far too large. I have stopped eating meat, started taking more mass transit, as well as I've begun to shop more at thrift stores. But I know many other people my age who would be very unlikely to make these changes. I know we’re supposed to be the generation to fix the climate crisis but, having so few options to take; that can make a difference today- it makes me feel defeated. The older generations refuse to take action and lessen their impact but expect us to make up for their faults. One of the bigger actions we can take is voting but a large chunk of the people that actually care about the environment are not of voting age. Compared to the majority of the older generations who don’t even consider climate change of their top priorities. I become more and more frustrated with every reading, film, and lecture. There is so much that needs to be done and it needs to happen right now but, along with climate skeptics who are consistently pushing back, there are people who are fine sitting back and knowing they won’t be here to see the worst of it.

To answer the title of the video, yes one generation can do what previous generations failed to do. Young adults like myself are more willing to follow Ken’s five ways of reducing our climate footprint in comparison to older folks his age. When it comes to transportation, most young people do not own their own vehicles. I for example, have a license but do not own a car. I rely on biking, walking, and mass transportation already to get around. A lot of college students live this way as well. I understand why it is harder for older people to live like this, they have worked hard for their luxury vehicles. For them, being able to purchase a car was an accomplishment in life and therefore are not as willing to give it up. 
  <br><br>

In regards to housing, I would voluntarily live in cohousing because I think it would be nice to live in a tight community. I would share chores with them and my children would have other kids to play with; children whose parents I would know and trust. This point follows Ken’s advice in having two children maximum per household. This is easy for me to follow because I wish to adopt rather than have my own children. I think Ken should add adoption as a suggestion under the children reduction category. The planet cannot sustain all human so why make more when we can just care for the ones already on this planet who are orphaned.

It was quite shocking for me to hear that as early as 1854, scientists knew what the burning of fossil fuels would do to our environment. It is heartbreaking that the generations above us did nothing to ease our burden, and in fact made it even harder for us to carry. Changing entire systems and cultures and the way people live their lives can seem daunting, but it is not impossible. I just wish that the generations above us would have realized that change is necessary and beneficial, and that taking steps to protect the earth and future generations wouldn’t have been seen as anti American, but as the brave and right thing to do. However, what makes me the most upset is that these generations are still refusing to change! There are real tangible solutions out there and it angers me that the response of the older generation is contempt and selfishness and defensiveness. I think that the world would be such a better place if we were to all live sustainably. We would have more freedoms, not less. Our society is one defined by consumption, yet in a study measuring how happy American citizens are, we ranked extremely low despite the country’s affluence. I firmly believe that we would all be happier if we devoted more time into relationships and doing things that make others and ourselves happy, rather than spending all our time working so we can buy more and more things that we don't need and that won’t bring us happiness. I have been living the most sustainable, zero waste lifestyle I can and it brings me insurmountable joy to know that not only am I not contributing to the destruction of the planet, but I am much happier because I am focused on doing things I love with the people I love. It is so hard being an environmental studies major because I am bombarded with bad news all the time, and sometimes it seems hopeless. But what Ken said is true, knowledge without action is power squandered. By acting, I am making a difference and putting all the knowledge I have to good use. Now all that’s left is to get everyone else on earth to act on that same knowledge.

The first thing I did after watching “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?” is took notes of the 5 things Ken talked about for how to reduce our carbon footprint and sent it in a large group text to my family members. When I learn about information in this class I immediately share it because there will be more of an impact if I am able to spread the word. Luckily for me my family is very receptive to this information, and immediately feels inclined to change their ways as well. Ken confidently states in his other lecture this week that "in the early 1970’s if we asked the average american if we need to close our reliance on fossil fuels by the end of the 20th century the answer would have very likely been a decided yes, moreover failure to do so would result in an existential catastrophe for the human race”. It frustrates me to my core that the issues we are beginning to face now, our society knew about almost 50 years ago. I just don’t understand how 50 years have gone by with the knowledge of this “existential catastrophe” and there has been little to nothing done about it. Ken easily listed out 5 VERY EASY things that we as individuals can do to reduce our carbon footprint, and like he stated our generations response has been along the lines of “great! that sounds very easy to do! so simple!” How is it that a whole generation of people have lived on this earth and have been so greedy to have big houses and unlimited materialistic objects that they purposely avoided dealing with this so the responsibility now falls on a bunch of kids and young adults olds who won’t even have the opportunity to hold power positions for another twenty years. I am currently enrolled in 3 climate courses here at UCSB this quarter and it is starting to take a toll on me. Learning about our doom 5 days a week isn’t exactly a positive experience. These debates are science and logic fighting against selective ignorance and greed. On a positive note, from this class in particular I feel like it really has given me knowledge for how to make smarter decisions that reduce my carbon footprint. I have always been aware of how my actions effect the earth but this class definitely forces me to focus on the smaller details of my actions that I would generally have looked over.

I think that your comment is really powerful and a good model to what everyone should be doing. I think this was one of Ken's best lectures as he stated those 5 specific things that everyone can take part in to reduce our carbon footprint. It is information like this that the world needs, we don't need super scientific facts that no one will understand, we need a game plan that is attainable and straight forward. Sending that text to your family right away made me think of the idea of gossip and how quickly it can spread. If we can spread these simple steps in the same way as gossip, we can reach a greater range of people in a much quicker fashion and if we says exactly what needs to happen, maybe it will appeal to people in a better way. 
  <br><br>

Like you said, learning about our doom 5 days a week isn't a positive experience but I think it is these types of negative experiences that people need to endure in order to really make a mark and drive people to action. I think that its easier for this new generation to make these changes than in previous times as well as people are generally more conscious of environmental issues like animal cruelty which coincide with some of the steps we can take to help the climate crisis as well.

In this video, Ken details specific issues of generational cognitive dissonance when it comes to our need for sweeping change to address the climate crisis. In America, in particular, the generation that remains the culprit of this state of emergency still refuse to adapt with the changing world, whereas folks in younger generations tend to be more flexible with, or even desire, this new adaptive lifestyle. As has been said in prior videos, the American population, constituting of solely 4% of the world’s population, contributed a great deal to the climate crisis we now live within. One of the best explanatory factors offered was the idealization of consumption in this country. 
  <br><br>


Americans have long since been taught that we obtain freedom through the things we can earn through our hard work - homes, clothing, and cars being the best externalized examples of this. This inherently reinforces everything that restricts our freedoms and allows large transnational companies to maintain control through our pursuantly capitalistic lifestyles. 
  <br><br>


Even just looking at Exxon Mobil, one of the largest transnational companies in the world, they directly benefit from our consumption of things that damage the earth; why would they want Americans to stray from this ideology, especially when much of the world looks to the U.S. for a model of ideal life? In 2007, Exxon Mobil had $269 billion in foreign sales - with only 40% of the employee staff of Ford, they managed to make almost triple the profit. 

  <br><br>

As Ken also discussed, our generation, though perhaps my perception is skewed as I am a student in a class that primarily leans left, is much less reluctant to change our lives in 5 ways in order to have a positive impact on the earth. I believe this is partially attributed to a development in our approach to our freedom. I hope we ask ourselves, what does it mean to be free? Is it simply freedom to purchase? Or to protect and preserve the earth for future generations?

We, as Americans at least, are practicing wasteful freedom.This concept that our standard of life is represented by our stuff and our consumption is toxic, and we continue to mindlessly practice this lifestyle. Companies still create new fads, pointless fashions, and seasonal gimmicks in order to promote their business. This pointless abuse of capitalism is not only concentrating the wealth, but blinding society from focusing on all of the ways Ken has explained that a solution may be approached. I'm sure many of us were aware of these tactics already, yet with the world that we live in, it is almost too difficult to enact any immediate changes due to the inconvenience it might pose. However, as explained in the other lecture, generations before us have been aware of the issues as well, and even suffered from their consequences themselves. So why was our modern definition of "progress" still prioritized? One would think that, once the dangers on our current path were identified, it would follow that our progress need be redirected into work that protects society from these dangers. However, the sacrifice of convenience that the older generation faced must have been too high, which is understandable as they had spent their lifetime earning that convenience. The hesitancy for change stems from the fear of throwing away everything we know. 
  <br><br>

I have been working with young children for four years and I am going to compare my methodology to the stubborn mindset of meat eaters, violent shoppers, car junkies, and suburban royals. When children get into their heads that they want something to be a certain way, there is no reasoning. No conversation will bring a toddler to see the perspective of the educated, so the solution is to take control and totally manipulate the situation in order to correct it. In perfect world, our government would be the one to do this, however there is no total power that is capable of it. Some grand influence is needed in order to generate this manipulation and entirely redirect the minds of those who are stuck in their skewed mindsets and stuff obsessed lifestyles. While it may bring up concerns of communism, if totalitarian rule were to be enacted in order to defuse the meat industry, or reduce the amount of fashion malls that continue to pop up, or redefine the necessity for housing space of our country, the world would suffer less according to Ken's theories. And after the initial change, that new sustainable world would be all that the children of that generation know, and whatever sacrifices of stuff that had been made would fade away harmlessly, which is agreeably a much happier ending than the death of our beautiful planet.

Taking this course has changed the way that I look at my daily actions and consider the carbon footprint that each of my daily decisions could possibly have. Being a young college student,  I feel that making the changes that Ken has laid out won't be too difficult as I have in no way settled down into a "comfortable" and environmentally-detrimental lifestyle. However, for the older generations, I find that making these changes seems rather unlikely. I don't see my dad by any means switching his car for public transportation, or switching to a largely plant-based diet. Having a home in a cookie cutter neighborhood with a large family has become the standard of life where I'm from. Changing that mindset would be hard, but entirely necessary. If not, hopefully the radical change of lifestyle for the millions of younger people can offset the inaction of the older generation, even just a little bit. 


This course has made me realize how wasteful Americans are. Our consumer culture and infatuation with having new "things" has proved to have a huge impact on the global climate. We waste 1/3 to 1/2 of the food we produce... that is SOO much food. The beef industry is such a large contributor to greenhouse gases, and it's a shame to see that so much of it is wasted.

I agree, that I feel like these changes are doable, and I think that this response is exactly what Ken is talking about. I think one way that you can boil down this issue to personal level is about selfishness. And this is not coming as an insult to anyone who does not live like this, but these actions beg the question: How much are you as an individual willing to give up for the greater good of the world? I think that people's differing responses to this question make sense, and are products of our environment. If one person grows up around people who all think that these freedoms are a human and american right, then that person will probably think the same. If another person grows up with the upbringing being told to always think how your actions affect another, and that personal gains are not always worth it if it hurts another, then that person is probably going to think these same thoughts around this issue. I know that my parents have raised me the second way are are both very environmentally conscious so it makes sense that I am too. It surprises me, then, how many young people in my generation are having these thoughts even though they have parents who think radically differently then them on this issue. I think that these people, who are fighting for the environment even when it is more difficult in their family and social circles, are the ones who matter the most.


<br><hr>
I've experienced similar thoughts since I've began this class. This course has certainly caused me to bring into question my own carbon footprint and whether I'm being as environmentally safe as possible. What Ken said about how Americans, a relatively small population in comparison to the rest of the world, are responsible for 25% of all greenhouse gases put into the atmosphere really stood out to me. Americans are obligated to adopt more environmentally safe lives and practices since we have already caused so much damage.
  <br><br>

Recently, I have adopted a vegetarian diet for both health and environmental reasons. I also actually prefer thrifting and buying resold clothes to fast fashion (which is a very exploitative and environmentally hazardous industry). I will continue to work on other ways I can become a more environmentally conscious person in my actions because I feel that it's just the right thing to do for the sake of the planet and everyone and everything on it. I will also spread the information I learned from this course and course materials to the people I know outside of it because it is crucial that everyone is more aware of the climate crisis, how they contribute to it,  and act accordingly after.

<p>
I do believe that Ken goes into great lengths with the ideas of how to help reduce the carbon emissions that each person produces their lifetime, and honestly, I find it intriguing that for the response of his generation, he says that it would be a threat to the American life to suggest such a thing because they enjoy their personal freedoms. However, it got me thinking about the economic repercussions that come with these decisions.

  <br><br>

I would first like to preface that the suggestions that Ken provides are improbable for many people for one reason: a lot of these alternatives are more expensive. Ken says that people should get rid of their car and take mass transportation, which yes, if one sells their car, then they will obviously gain money. However, he also uses the alternative of living in a smaller space and getting rid of a car can be done by doing one simple thing: moving to an urban city. However, a majority of the time, the cost of living in an urban environment is more costly. Take Los Angeles for example. The median price per square foot is $517 in an urban area, whereas it would be $432 in the suburbs. This trend does not only exist in Los Angeles, but also in densely populated areas, such as Houston, New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia. I understand that the climate is at risk, but there are many people who cannot afford to make that transition. I am by no means saying that we should not take this cost cut, but I do always think about the opposing side when an argument arises, and that is an easy counterpoint to make when bringing up the point of moving to an urban area.
  <br><br>


Another alternative that Ken makes is to waste less food (which I completely agree with), but the more costly approach, to turn to a plant-based diet. This is another issue that many Americans face because processed-foods are easier to access (as seen through the lack of healthy options at fast food restaurants) and the cost of healthier foods. On average, healthier foods are $1.50 more per day per person. Now, to a good amount of people, this many seem like that much. Yet, for a family that is on the brink of barely affording the food on their table now, they are simply unable to switch. If someone were to go all out on the climate change impact by moving to an urban area and switching to a healthier diet, they would definitely be spending more money than they currently do. 
  <br><br>


Even with the other alternatives, such as not being as materialistic (an example being clothing), there are economic downsides. The manufacturing industry would plummet, which is a major asset of employment not even in America, but around the world. There are giant aspects of the economy that may fail because of the changes that people make when they feel that they should help combat the climate in their own personal way. But here is the question: is our economy with giving up for our planet? 

  <br><br>

Personally, I believe that there are costs and benefits to both sides and it is uncertain what one gives up for the other just quite yet. However, we have seen the economy dominate and our planet suffer, and maybe it is time for the opposite to occur. With no planet, there exists no arena for our economy to exist.

For the past weeks, we’ve been eager to find out what we can do to decrease the consequences of climate change and in this lecture Ken clearly points out 5 ways. I’ll admit, these methods are easier said than done. The first one is transportation. If we were to trade in our cars, we’d cut a quarter of carbon footprints. Next, he mentions housing to decrease another quarter of carbon footprint. City living makes the transportation and housing adjustments easier, less car use and more efficient housing. I think the third one is the easiest and most beneficial to your health. He suggests wasting less food and eating a bigger plant based diet. Not only will this have a healthy impact on your body, but the amount of greenhouse gases will severely decrease. Although his fourth suggestion will probably have the greatest impact, I believe he’s asking for too much. The population has increased extremely in the last 60 years, it’ll be a long time to even have somewhat of a grasp on population control. Lastly, he suggests to keep what you have longer and consider shopping at thrift stores. A combination of these can cut your carbon footprint to half or a quarter. These 5 tasks aren’t impossible but many aren’t going to change without an incentive of some sort. None of these methods are something I haven’t heard before yet we still haven’t made progress.

I would like to comment on the last part of your response: "None of these methods are something I haven’t heard before yet we still haven’t made progress."
  <br><br>
I agree that these 5 methods are not unheard of. In fact, I think most people, even the older generations, know of these 5 methods. Frankly, nobody cares, and they will not start to care. Perhaps when something disastrous happens on a global scale, but most people will just keep denying that climate change is the cause. 
  <br><br>
I think we have to look at climate change in a critical and realistic way - we keep on talking about voting, eating a plant-based diet, using public transportation, etc., but how realistic is it, exactly? We cannot escape from reality, and now, we live in a world governed by the older generation that is afraid to change their destructive, yet comfortable ways. How realistic is it for the fundamental structure of our lives to change? How many university students are learning about climate change in the world right now? How many business owners value environmental protection over profit?
  <br><br>
This definitely does not mean that I will not do my best to combat climate change. Over the years, I have introduced small changes to my life that I am grateful for today. However, that is just me. And hopefully the others taking this course. And other environmentally-conscious people in the world. Frankly, I think we belong to a very small percentage of the people in this world.

It will be very interesting to see if the 5 things you outlined in your video will be adopted at mass in order to enact change. Personally I find it hard to believe that America will stop its obsession with consumer culture. As long as capitalism is prevalent in the united states consumerism will be as well. My contention is that the solutions to the climate crisis along with other environmental catastrophes will stem from science and engineering. I don't think most people will adopt plant-based diets. After all, we are omnivores and meat is one of the best ways to get the nutrition you need. Also I don't think everyone will want to live in cities. I would much rather live somewhere where I am outdoors in nature even if it means using a car everyday.
  <br><br>
I think the 5 things you stated are good ideas but lack widespread appeal to be adopted at mass. This is another reason for why I believe the solution to the climate crisis will come from science and engineering.

To me this lecture was very eye opening because I have always thought that the older generation was just ignorant and selfish for rejecting lifestyle changes that are more environmentally friendly. From my perspective, these lifestyle changes are not only simple, but are changes I'd like to make simply because they promote overall health and happiness. It has never occurred to me people from previous generations feel like making these lifestyle changes would be robbing them of what they have rightfully earned (big houses, fancy clothes, fast cars, etc.) after years and years of hard work. Although this mentality is deeply flawed from an environmental standpoint, I don't necessarily blame the older generation for feeling this way. After all, who was it that put these notions into their heads? The idea that the older generation has about the "American dream" was largely fabricated by corporations just trying to sell their product and make money. They implemented ideas such as "bigger is better" and "out with the old, in with the new" as a way to sell their products and the American public ate it up. Should the previous generation have done more to combat the effects of climate change? Absolutely. But we should also consider that the consumption-heavy lifestyle they live was instilled in them by major corporations and that is another problem of its own. 
  <br><br>

As I previously stated, the solutions presented by Professor Hiltner appear as not only manageable but as alluring ways to improve my overall lifestyle. Because I know that many other people my age share this mentality, I have some confidence that my generation will be able to get a handle on the issue of climate change. Although generations before us have failed to do right by the environment, I can already feel a shift in the social climate towards a more eco-friendly nation and world.

After watching “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do” I learned 5 ways people can get involved and help climate change. The main question everyone asks is how can I get involved to help climate change? Ken lists 5 good examples to answer your question. The one that had the biggest impact on me is changing to a plant based diet. I have been thinking of trying a plant-based diet for a while now, but never have committed to doing so. As an athlete everyone talks about the benefits a plant based diet has on your performance at a high level. Now that I learned the effects it has on climate change it is a no brainer to switch to a plant based diet. Ken states if we do all of the 5 things he mentions it will cut climate footprint in half, which is very significant. Ken also states the responses of some people born in his generation that don't agree with the 5 things to help climate change. My response to them is what is more important living your life the way you want to and hurting the planet and the next generation or making the plant a better place for years to come? I think many people in this world are selfish and that is why climate change has increased in recent years.

I completely agree with you on how surprising it is that changing your diet could do so much. I, too, have been wanting to change to a mostly plant based diet because of Ken's lectures, documentaries, and reading, but have never committed to it. After watching this video, I have been more conscious of what I eat now as I know that there are people in this world who are changing their diets to save the earth which gives me the extra push I need to fully commit. Sadly, I also agree with the fact that people are selfish and have not considered the effects of climate change on the generations in the future, not just their own. Because the future seems so far removed from the people of the past generation, it is difficult for them to conceptualize how dire the situation is. Coupled with this mindset is the nature of selfishness in people. These two aspects combined together makes for a useless and ignorant generation of people who will ruin the environment without thinking of the future generations.

I am genuinely not surprised about how each generation reacted.  At the beginning of the video when you said, both generations had different responses, I already had an idea of what you meant.  It seems to me as if the generation that contributed to the climate crisis are the ones who do not care and want to continue to make the Earth even worse.  According to you the 5 different things we can do for a big change are:  transportation, travel in bikes, walk, commute.  The second one is, Housing, this can count for a quarter of the climate crisis.  People should live in small apartments or smaller homes.  The third being Food, we waste so much food.  There is so much food that is made and not even eaten.  As well as, meat, this is a huge contributor of greenhouse gases.  The fourth is the population is increasing and by a lot.  People can have no more than 2 children in order for the Earth to be able to sustain, enough people.  At this rate the Earth will not be able to handle 10 billion people which is the number the population is quickly increasing to.  The fifth and final one is clothing.  People buy 60 or more pieces of clothing per year.  This also contributes to the Climate Crisis.  The response of my generation was, "Is that it, can doing those 5 simple things make that much of a difference."  And, "Doesn't sound bad at all, sounds desirable."  While the older generations' reaction was, "That sounds horrible, I love my car, and all the things I can buy are because of my hard work."  As you can see both generations have very different responses.

The five steps that Ken proposes were definitely not new nor groundbreaking, personally. However, I understand the importance of easily outlining and detailing how such seemingly small changes can result in such a large impact in your personal carbon footprint. In terms of my own participation in the changes, it's sort of all in on some while the others seem impossible to adopt on a global or national scale. For example, when it comes to transportation, I found it very easy to personally adopt a model of mainly public transportation and on foot. Even so, I do know that many people cannot function in their lives without cars, whether that be through a job or social aspect that requires that mode of transportation. In that sense, it seems more dependent on the government for matters like the advancement of better public transportation and housing. Though in terms of generational change, I feel as though the third step, population reduction, seems much more achievable at the moment as the world continues to advance towards more birth control, educating women, etc in the less developed countries. As Ken said in the first lecture, educating women about birth control may be the most impactful way to fight against the climate crisis.
  <br><br>


When it comes to the second lecture, the information covered during it seemed familiar as Ken went over many of the details briefly in lecture, but delved way deeper into the history and such that led to the worsening of the climate crisis. I appreciate that he acknowledged that without proper utilization, knowledge is practically worthless. It causes me endless frustration whenever I look at the political positional history of the climate change issue. The abhorrent ups and downs of its prominence as a political issue often makes me question whether or not change is even possible as the most of the world agrees that the climate crisis is here, while this nation twiddles it's thumbs.



</p><hr>


<p>

Ken's points are valid, however some of them seem rather impractical. This would include the solution of stopping the use of cars and using solely public transportation. While cities like Manhattan or San Francisco can pull this off because of the commute that the city has, they have many options for public transportation like subways, buses, etc. When I visited San Francisco, I get scared of the traffic and confusing roads so I'd much rather use public transportation. But cities where public transportation isn't as common, people would much more prefer to drive.

  <br><br>

This makes me feel like I can barely do anything about climate change as well. Even if I, myself, followed these solutions, which would be difficult, I wouldn't make much change if I did it by myself. I feel like we'd need a much more than a handful of people to make such an impact to reverse the damages we've done to the planet.

While I agree with the sentiment that you or any individual changing their lifestyle to reduce their carbon footprint wouldn't make much of a difference to reversing the impact of climate change, the generational change that Ken hopes for has to start SOMEWHERE and somehow. A widespread change in how we live and think can only happen starting from individuals like you and me. Not using cars at all and solely relying on public transportation DOES see impractical, but you don't need to make such a drastic switch at once; taking the subway or bus when you're not in a hurry and driving when you are is a feasible, not so overwhelming first step towards mitigating the acceleration of climate change. These seemingly insignificant actions are needed to encourage the transformation of public infrastructure of not only your local area, but also your county if not your state.

Sure, there are many things that we can do as individuals that are small in order to help the environment. The problem with that unfortunately is that not a lot of people want to… guilty as charged, this includes me as well. Sure, I try to do my part, I’ve started limiting the amount of red meat that I consume, but I haven’t cut it out of my diet completely. As Ken mentioned, there are other things that we can do that I am already doing such as living in a place where a car is not necessary and not buying many new clothes, but it’s not because I want to. In fact, I am here at a university trying to be in a better position in the future financially to stop doing all these things. I’m working hard to be able to have that nice car that I’ve always wanted, that beautiful large home I’ve envisioned since childhood, and all the new clothes and fashion accessories that I would want. This is very conflicting because I know how bad the climate crisis is and it will only get worse, but like many others, we are here to be able to do those aforementioned things that are associated with success and unfortunately has a direct correlation to the climate crisis. 
  <br><br>

Although, one thing that this university will help me do better for the climate is actually what I’m studying. I’m studying mathematics with an application in physics which I hope to apply towards helping make renewable energy the standard across the globe. Am I dreaming too big? Perhaps. But one can only try. I’m sure, however, that many more students are somehow on the path to the fight against climate change in many other majors and subjects across this school.This may come off as hypocritical considering my previous statements, but I truly care. It’s just difficult to abandon a vision that I’ve had for as long as I can remember. 
  <br><br>

I know that I’m not the only person with this dilemma as my friends and I have discussed this exact topic before. It’s a touchy subject, all things considered, and I hope to slowly wean myself off of this state of mind and begin to do my part by partaking in these small, yet meaningful tasks that will help the climate.

I too have a very similar dilemma where my aspirations for my future conflict with my environmental consciousness. Like yourself, I hope to have the means to be able to fulfill my materialist/childhood fantasies. I want a big house, and more than one car, and decadent meals. Like Ken said, I want "everything my parents had and more," but I have to accept that that lifestyle and culture of consumption has to be a thing of the past. There must be a dramatic shift in the way we as Americans eat, shop, and develop if there is any hope of slowing down are planets deterioration, and this shift in culture must take place in my lifetime.

  <br><br>

However, I'm often very concerned about the role of technology and specifically social media in this cultural shift. I feel as though social media often works to reinforce and solidify the aspects of American culture most detrimental to our planets climate. It fetishizes capitalism and consumerism. Glamorizing big houses, fast cars, red meat, jewelry, fashion and excessive shopping, and I worry it will lead to more generations that consume without any environmental awareness. While social media can be utilized to spread information and organize movements around climate change, it often works against the changes we need to make for the future.
  <br><br>


Also, I really like your career aspirations, I have a similar dream for my own future, and I wish you the best of luck.

After watching, “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?” I learned about five common things that can help cut our carbon footprint in half. Although all these five little changes do not sound that bad or difficult to change and implement to our everyday lifestyles, I think the reality is that most people, especially in the world we live in today, will not be willing to act in agreement with these changes. Many people today have become so accustomed to how we live and do not see the benefits that can come from slightly altering their lifestyles in ways that will help the environment. I think the problem is that people are lacking education in the climate crisis. The climate crisis is not talked about as much in the media as it should be. Today, media is a major tool used to spread awareness and knowledge to the world such as social media for example. I think people need to utilize social media and the media general to flood it with knowledge and concern about the climate crisis for people to acknowledge it and realize that awareness needs to be taken on this subject. This may help people feel the need to take action and also serve as a constant reminder that the climate crisis is happening. This will also help people acknowledge and realize that if many people are doing it around them such as their friends, families, or celebrities, seeing how easy it is to make such simple changes, realizing that its a manageable thing they can start doing and teaching to their children, friends, and family enabling more people around the world becoming more environmentally friendly one step at a time.

I agree with you, I also learned five ways on how to reduce my carbon footprint in half. Without realizing it, I practice the 4 out of 5 ways of reducing my carbon footprint. First of all, I practice not having a huge home, since I live on campus but I am not sure if that helps or not. I also walk or bike around school or isla vista. To go downtown or somewhere relatively far walking, I usually take the bus. I do not really buy new clothing, I have hand me downs from my older brother or cousins, I still use some clothes that are 5 years old, and I love thrift shops mainly because they are cheaper. Finally, I do not have any kids. It sucks to know that I should only limit myself to one kid because I wanted a big family, but I would rather have one kid to live in a beautiful planet then have three kids suffering in hell. However the one thing I do not practice is eating a diet mainly based on plants and I think is because I am not knowledgeable. Growing up, people always said you need certain nutrients to stay healthy so you have to eat meat but I recently found out about supplements to help you gain those nutrients. If the media would inform us about these supplements and how healthy a plant based diet is, I think it will be easier for people to change their lifestyles.

These methods for how to fight against climate change on an individual scale are somewhat practical and seem to be able to make a little bit of a difference. While I do think these changes may make a small difference, I feel as if it is not enough to make a noticeable or worthwhile change. I recognize that if enough people do this, a large difference will be made. I am just not sure and or confident that people are willing to give up their lifestyles for a problem that seems much larger than us. Personally, I would not give my car up or make major lifestyle changes to reduce my carbon footprint by whatever small fraction of what is needed to turn around the climate crisis. Admittedly, I am a pessimist and do not see a bright future for earth and humanity without an external change, like a natural change in global weather, or some technological advance to fight the problem. If these methods are not enforced or incentivized, I know I am very unlikely to put an effort into them because I do not see these drastic lifestyle changes as being worth the cost of making a minuscule difference to the problem as a whole. I feel like many people make these lifestyle changes to make themselves feel better about their perceived impact as well as a sense of doing something meaningful, not because they truly believe their individual efforts will make an impactful difference.

In the video, Can Once generation Do What Another Failed to do? The responses of the different generations really stood out to me. The younger generation normally replying with “that’s all and I will reduce my footprint substantially?” I found this interesting because I feel as if a lot of people even in the younger generation sadly talk before they walk. Yes, they might say “That’s easy, I will ride my bike and not drive.” Then later on are too tired, and pick up their car keys and drive to the store. “I will use reusable bags at the grocery store” Then get to the store and they left their bags in the car and are too lazy to go out and get them and resort to plastic. “I’m not going to buy anything I don’t need” Then find themselves aimlessly online shopping and buy an object that they thought is neat, or cute, or in fashion. “I’m going to stop eating meat” then see a burger they very day they said it and gobble it down.  How do we stop this cycle? How do we make people accountable for the actions they promise to take? 
  <br><br>

I agree with Ken that the younger generation is much for forward thinking in terms of environmentalism and the steps that they can take to reduce their footprint, especially compared to the older generation. However, many of us have grown up living luxurious lives. We live in houses that are way larger than we need them to be, we drive out of convivence, we fly across the world for a weeklong vacation. We have excess food to make sure we don’t go hungry. I guess my concern is that people are talking the talk, but when it comes to actually making the action that they say they are going to take they fall back into a place where they don’t want to give up the comfort that they know. How do we change this bigger is better culture, and society driven by consumptions and trends? 
  <br><br>

The line that really stood out to me in this video was “knowledge is power, but only when we act.” I think this goes for the younger generation. It is now our turn to put this knowledge into actions and sticking to our word to better the planet.

Money! The all-powerful dollar is ever present in our consumer society. The society we live in is entirely structured around how much money you have. Class is not signified by skin color any more, it is about how much money you have and how you spend it. For these reasons, I believe it will be extremely difficult to convince our society to adopt a green lifestyle. Some aspects of the lifestyle wouldn’t be all that difficult to implement. For example, alternative foods are already gaining popularity with the masses. Foods like the impossible burger are being marketed as alternatives to meat and I could see it expanding in the future to make up a large portion of our diet. In a somewhat similar way, electric cars are helping reduce carbon emissions slightly and have amassed a following. Tesla is an example of how electric cars have gained massive popularity and are symbols of class. However, as you highlighted in your video, the Cars we drive and the houses we own are part of our society’s identity. The big house and the nice car are staples of American success. We are a land of excess and more than likely, the things we buy are representative of our perceived wealth in society. That’s why you don’t see college kids driving Lambos … unless… Anyways what I was saying is it is going to be borderline impossible for us to convince the public to live in a smaller house and give up their cars, people also love buying new clothes, but thrift shopping exists and I hope it becomes more common to reuse than replace. If collectively we can agree to reduce our intake of meat, buy more second-hand clothes, and have children at a rate of 1 to1 then I would say it was a success. I just can’t see most of this country throwing away aspirations of a big house and a nice car any time soon.

I find it interesting that these five points to help personally improve the climate crisis all actually happen to be lifestyle changes that I naturally find myself drawn to life a happier life (with exception to the meat option). I saw over the years how my dad had to make the weekday commutes to the the city from where he lived, which slowly he came to hate more and more over the years that he was forced to do it. The other two big potions that resonate the most with me are the consumerism and housing points. After realizing hoe much junk I had accumulated over my childhood, it made me realize how much of a weight it all felt like. Further when I moved into my college dorm last year I also realized that living in a small space was nicer both because it was easier to maintain, but also because the smaller space kept me from getting too much stuff which made me happier. 
  <br><br>

Personally when I hear the opinions of the older generation so say that living in a small space, using public transport, and having few children is restricting our Americans freedoms and is communism/socialism (which has been ingrained into the public to be the evilest of all evils) it makes me a bit sick. There should be a name for this phenomenon and it should be called “toxic americanism” not just because it is toxic to the planet on which we live, but also because it is toxic to the society in which we live.

I love the term you created of toxic americanism and I think that this is a totally valid concept. Americans always say that freedom is most important. Where is the freedom for communities plagued by environmental injustices? Where is the freedom for people who do not have access to clean water or healthy foods? Where is the freedom for workers forced to labor away and die in factories so that Americans can have fast fashion? Where is the freedom for people who work themselves to death so that they can buy things they don't need in order to keep up with the Jones'? Where is the freedom for the plants and animals that have been destroyed and butchered both wild and domestic? I don't see it. And I certainly think many Americans need to rethink their definition of freedom, because to say that it is to be able to buy whatever you want whenever you want it no matter the consequences is total bullshit.

Now I can answer the question “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?”. YES, and it depends on how WILLING our generation is going to react.  Even though we do understand the severity of climate change, people are just living their original lives instead of standing and stepping out their first steps to make this entire thing different. Firstly, there are plenty of places and programs that are providing vegan food or vegetarian options of dishes recently, just to promote how important that we, as a consumer, have to stop consuming this great amount of pure meat or any other food that contains meat-related ingredients. It’s pretty common that there’s also Vegan Green Day happening in UCSB. However, what I discovered is that people from Ken’s generation cannot get used to this trend. They still possess the mindset of eating meat or chicken so that they can get enough protein for a day. Therefore, this will still be an existing problem towards the process of our generation taking actions to reduce climate change. On the other side, it’s also an astonishing fact that even some people from our generation reject being a vegan. Last week when my friend and I went to have lunch at a place where all food is vegan, my friend only took desserts and soup, and after a while he started to complain about not eating meat in a meal. From this experience, I deeply understand how difficult it is to promote “vegan” and to convince people to change their eating habits or styles. Not to mention, the living ways people are accustomed to now are extremely hard to be modified. Hence, in my opinion, the knowledge we acquired should be taken out through actions so that it will be worthy.

I really enjoy how you brought up the idea of Vegan Green Day here at UCSB because, in the dining commons, it is a frequent thing. Our university does an amazing job of ensuring that we help to combat the climate crisis as much as possible. I think that is a very admirable aspect of our university and we take great pride in the fact that we are contributing to combating the heating climate. 

  <br><br>

However, people prefer convenience. And in all honesty, holding a vegan diet is much less of e convenience than the average diet. Yes, many restaurants are starting to place an emphasis on plant-based diets and definitely have implemented different items on their menu to cater for these people. However, what being vegan does is also place limits on the items and restaurants that a person can obtain. Some people would not like to put in that much effort into what they are eating (which is also why dieting is extremely difficult). Placing effort into places where humans do not usually place it makes their lives more difficult, and one reasoning behind the anti-veganism movement is because it makes life harder. 

  <br><br>

By no means do I agree with this sentiment, but when I talked to my friends about becoming vegan, this topic comes around time and time again. However, climate change is hard to combat, and therefore, requires harder decisions to be made.



<br><hr>
Firstly, I appreciate you for commenting on my work. I agree with your points in which changing human behavior is such a difficult task for the world. People are selfish as we all know. However, things should be seen transparently and people must be aware of the crisis we are living in. As a result, we, our uninhabitable planet, will not get better unless we make changes on ourselves first.

The first 3 weeks of this class have absolutely changed the way I go about my day and the ways I eat etc. I've realized that I have a much smaller carbon footprint compared to many other students/ people due to the fact that I ride my bike everywhere. By only driving about once a week, it is almost as if i'm living in a city like Ken was talking about. Secondly, I have become much more conscious of the amount of food I waste and have not thrown away any food at all. Now I'm not making this post to get a "good job!" instead i'm just reflecting on the last three weeks and my carbon footprint. The harder aspect of food for me is moving to a plant based diet, though I have been trying to eat less meat. 
  <br><br>


As for the clothes, many of my clothes from thrift stores or I have been wearing them for years. 

  <br><br>

And lastly, the amount of children. Though I have no children of mine own right now, I can see why this may be an issue to some people. One thing about this however is that the average kids under 18 years old per family was 1.93 in America. That means for the families that have 6 kids, there are a couple families with none to average it out.
  <br><br>


Overall I think these steps are not overly difficult to do and is something that most people can do as well.

I agree that these steps are very easy to accomplish! It concerns me, however, that Ken's generation sees these steps as something disruptive to their daily lives. I always look to older people for wisdom. So, I wonder why they see the steps as so difficult or obnoxious? There must be a valid reason. I think the main reason might be because they didn't grow up hearing about the climate crisis. What you grow up hearing affects your behavior as an adult. For example, if a little girl grows up hearing that her family is in stable financial condition, she won't ever think much about finances until she has to take care of her own money. However, if a little girl grows up hearing that her family is in poor financial condition due to, let's say, an economic crash, she will naturally be more cautious with her spending. This conditioning as a child affects your views on the world, your opinions, your willingness to change, and a lot more!

Just as Ken said I would feel, the five things I can do to cut my footprint in half does seem quite easy. These things especially seem simple while in college, my transportation is a bike, I am sharing a small house with 8 people, I prefer to eat more plant based and I don’t have any money to buy a lot of stuff. But the points he brings up are valid that people believe they make money so they should spend it and society has grown to want bigger and bigger houses. These are things society changed to fairly quickly and I think it is something we could stray away from. One thing that I find very interesting are two trends that are going around, tiny houses and minimalism. These both tie together, all over the internet you can find videos how people are happier living this lifestyle and I agree. I think it all just comes back to the saying, “Money can’t buy you happiness”. This is not only relevant in the idea of having less stuff, but also if we continue our lavish lifestyles, we are continuing to kill the planet.
  <br><br>

I also found it very interesting how concerned people were about CO2 in the past, that this idea of not having anymore put people into constant fear. Sounds very similar to climate deniers now. But the issue was people in the past were scared because the US was running out of it, but now people need to shift this fear to our planet. Just as people could have changed to renewable energy in the past we must do this now. Another factor is meat consumption, I was shocked how well known society was on methane in the past. Therefore why don’t people care now? I think with food industries inventing more and more plant based options hopefully people will begin to switch. Although the way for this to work plant based diets cannot be branded as more expensive. People need to show how sustainable beans and other non meat item are in order for this to be successful.

I agree with how relatively easy the solutions he proposed were. We need to start weaning off our use of cars which I am happy to be doing here, even though it just because I don't have a car here. I love the community here and biking to school, and when needed I bus to get places farther away. I find biking enjoyable and the bus to not be bad at all. I'm not only glad that I'm not using a car but I actually find it enjoyable. While a car is convenient since I drive one at home,  I am aware of how harmful it is so I am glad that UCSB is an environment where you don't need one. For housing, I think America's obsession with huge houses is so unlike the cultures of the rest of the world with normal sized houses instead of extravagant ones especially for small families. Isla Vista also provides small housing which is usually shared amongst many roommates. In a way, the Isla Vista community is almost representative of an environmental utopia of where we should be; walking, biking and public transportation and multi-family housing. There are many events where students can buy second hand clothing and go thrifting for very cheap or free and they are popular. The students at UCSB are also very conscious of their food and veganism and vegetarianism are widely popular here. Since being here and taking this class I have been trying to cut down on meat consumption. Being surrounded by the environmentally progressive culture where its all normalized definitely takes an effect on my actions. Now what we need is for the rest of America to have a similar culture. It is popular here in IV to bike, be vegan, and thrift clothing and other items. It gives me hope that because we are so receptive and its ingrained in our culture that it can spread to the rest of California and the US as a whole. 
  <br><br>
I think the generational lifestyle divide is very clear as the examples Ken gave of people saying that the "American lifestyle was being threatened" by boomers. It's a statement that I've heard from people and is a common gas lighting statement used by people who are climate deniers and don't want progress to be made. The reality is that American lifestyle is an illusion. Our overconsumption is based off the backs of people around the world who are working for our consumption and living in more modest conditions. We don't pay the full cost of everything we have and have grown up with a false sense of security in our resources when in reality we are the ones depleting the world's resources. Our lifestyle is unlike any other country's and it needs to change. Most Americans are so pretentious that our lifestyle is right with huge lawns, meals, cars, houses and material items when the rest of the world doesn't live like us. My generation has grown up with that lifestyle but I do not believe that we place the same value on all of those material items the same way that most boomers' identity and pride is based in all of their cars, homes and items. I do have hope that our generation is more willing to compromise the lavish lifestyles we were born into and adapt into a greener lifestyle.

Ken talks about 5 simple things that each individual can do to reduce their carbon footprint by about half or even more. These 5 things are all easily done if one wants to do them. I think that the plant based diet is a big one and should be done for so many other reasons in addition to reducing your carbon footprint. An excuse a lot of people have for not being vegetarian or vegan is that they don’t think they will get enough protein and they can’t give up hamburgers or something. In reality though, there are so many more sources of protein that people just aren’t educated on or understand. When it comes to people not wanting to give up a hamburger, or chicken, or fish, they can just cut out other meat products and that will still improve the environmental impact. Reducing your meat intake is still so much better than doing nothing at all. 
  <br><br>
Food waste is also a huge issue as about ⅓ to ½ of all food is wasted. We see this a lot in the dining commons here at school. Hundreds of students go in and out of the dining hall all day and most people don’t even finish half their food and throw it on the dish rack and be wasted. Clearly, diet has a huge impact on the environment, and it is something so simple that each individual can change, yet most people still don’t.  
  <br><br>
The concept of consumerism and the way of living most Americans go by is so sad and disappointing. It is horrible to see that the US only has 4% of the population, but are responsible for 25% of greenhouse gases emitted into the air, mostly from this consumerist lifestyle. Instead of focusing so much on how much stuff we have and how big our houses are, we should think more about what actually matters to us like friends, family and nature. I feel like we are all guilty of participating in, to some extent, this consumerist lifestyle and we all have room to improve and think about what really matters to us most. 
  <br><br>
Once people get past the idea that changing your lifestyle to be more environmentally friendly and sustainable will reduce their quality of life and see that it could actually make them happier and improve their life, we can start to make real collective change through small individual change.

I appreciate that you emphasized the danger of focusing on the overpopulation aspect of climate change. Many people, especially those with dated environmentalist ideals, believe that overpopulation is the most critical component of our environmental woes. Although there is some validity to this argument, it is not cohesive, practical, ethical, or necessarily accurate. Focusing on population size has historically validated the opinions of many racist, xenophobic, and hateful ideologies, such as the "Tragedy of the Commons" theory made famous by Garrett Hardin. Although the basis of his argument does make logical sense, it was just taken for truth without ever being proven empirically. Not only was it inaccurate, it was an extension of Hardin's white supremacist values where he saw minority populations as the "problem" and that in order to fix this problem, we must control the gene pool of future generations. He was able to convey these problematic values under the guise of environmental science by focusing on the overpopulation aspect of the climate problem, which is not the only issues worth focusing on. The human population is already too big, and it will continue to grow - that is inevitable. But it is not the size of the population alone that is driving anthropogenic climate change. It is disproportionately driven by a small fraction of wealthy individuals and corporations whose carbon-intensive activities significantly outweigh the combined activities of the majority of the world's people. So let's not focus on population size, but consumption and activity instead.

When I first heard about how much a plant-based diet could reduce my carbon footprint, I was shocked but thought that there was no way I could survive without meat (what a myth that was). I have been doing a plant-based diet for almost a year now and the benefits extend beyond the environment. I think the reason some of these things seem so hard to us is because of the myths that surround them. For one, I always thought a plant-based diet would cost more; it actually has reduced my monthly grocery bill by at least $150-200. As someone who loves weight lifting and living a healthy lifestyle, I also thought it would be impossible to gain muscle without meat...I have gained more muscle and strength off of a plant-based diet in a year than I did in three years of consuming a lot of meat (for protein needs). These are just a few examples of how impossible I thought a plant-based diet would be, but now that I've been doing it for awhile, I love it. The beginning was very hard as I didn't know what or where to eat-but you adjust overtime, just like with anything. In regards to the materialism obsession Americans participate in, I remember doing a presentation about the fast-fashion industry for a class I had over the Summer, and I was so shocked about what my research turned up. Simply not participating in the fast-fashion industry can have such a positive effect on not only the environment, but the workers of the fast-fashion industry as well.

Yeah, it has been engraved in our culture to think that “more is better” and that we can’t live without meat, or that we are a hindrance if we are not actively participating in the capitalist economy. But history has proven that we don’t even need half of the stuff we have. Just living in a dorm has shown me how much a small space can really be. Simply changing the little things we do in life can have such a profound and positive effect on ourselves and the planet. Eating healthier or living a minimalist life has proven to make people happier. The movie Minimalism, for instance, explains how having so much stuff leads to us feeling unhappy and unsatisfied. But by taking the time to actually own things that make us happy, we will be able to see an improvement in our mood. A lot of us have gotten so comfortable with this extremely problematic lifestyle that we don’t see all the negative impacts it has on our lives. 
<br><br>
What is so frustrating is that again people are changing the climate issue into something that it is not. The Climate Crisis is not a freedom issue, but people continue to view it as such. Yes, you will have to change to prevent the end of the world, it’s not that hard to believe or do. Climate change has to do with preventing tragedies and helping to save the planet, not with our “freedom”. If we do not change the way we live, our entire world could be at stake and everyone will pay the consequence of our inaction.

I decided to go vegan last year for environmental reasons. This is often stated as the more controversial lifestyle change that the average person can do. I also have a decent amount of health issues, and to the shock of my doctors, I have less severe symptoms than they expect me to have. I largely contribute this to my diet that is free of gluten, dairy, meat, and other animal products. 
<br><br>
One of the things that I am often asked about by my peers is protein and nutrients. To this, I also say that there is way more protein in plants than people think is possible. I write this drinking a smoothie that has 35 grams of protein.
<br><br>
Much like the climate of doubt video, the meat and pharmaceutical industry don’t want people to realize that their diet can completely change their health. These industries spread disinformation in the same manner as the fossil fuel industry with ads such as the “got milk?” campaign and funding research demonstrating the “benefits” of an omnivorous diet. Thankfully, people have begun to realize the environmental destruction of eating meat and how unsustainable it is for their health. 
<br><br>


I write this in reflection as to how often people believe all the information being fed to us, whether it is true or not. This ties into Ken’s belief of “knowledge as power” in the other youtube lecture. However, I want to add my own stipulation that knowledge is fully understood and chosen for yourself, is power.

<br><hr>
I have recently started to not eat beef to reduce my carbon footprint, and I also don’t believe that I can live without consuming meat. Yet, after hearing that you have been thriving off of a plant based diet it makes me want to test the water a little bit more. I have recently been trying to gain weight and started lifting because I have been underweight for many years now and would like to be healthier. Hearing that you have gained more muscle off of a plant based diet is very encouraging to me as I also want to cut down on my carbon footprint, but still want to take in enough protein to gain weight and muscle. I do believe it may take me some time to be able to go vegetarian, but I have taken the first step and hopefully soon will be able to take more steps into becoming a vegetarian. I also have adopted some parts of minimalism in order to reduce my footprint. I have decided on not buying any new clothes unless I need to and also stopped buying all other unnecessary products that I wanted. Materialism in America is a huge problem that needs to be addressed as it is very destructive, but I believe it will take some time before we convince people to stop consuming so much.
<br><hr>
I too was underweight for my whole life, and about four years ago I decided to do something about it. My answer for the first three years was "meat meat meat." While I did gain muscle slowly through lifting and eating a lot of meat, I noticed the biggest difference in my time of a plant-based diet! I hope you continue to be inspired to trying a plant-based diet so you can see for yourself how good it feels! And keep up the good work with buying less "new" clothing! This is something I am also working on.
<br><hr>
Like your peers, I was worried about protein intake as well! One documentary that really opened my eyes to the plant-based diet was "What the Health" on Netflix! I've this realized that a plant-based diet has more to offer than meat!
<br><hr>
Living in a dorm opened my eyes too! Before coming to college, I lived in my own apartment and when I moved, I had to throw away or sell at least 75% of my stuff...Since living in dorms, I realize how much easier a smaller life is in terms of stuff
<br><hr>
I, too, did some research on the fast fashion industry and the whole series of problems behind the industry, like worker exploitation, extremely high-risk workplace in Bangladesh, child labor in Vietnam, overproduction, non-degradable fabric material, and toxic burning smoke, etc. I strongly agree that not spending your money for the fast fashion industry or avoiding overconsumption in general is not only a great way to mitigate the environmental crisis but also a powerful contribution to the improvement of low-wage laborers’ wellbeing.

After watching professor Ken’s lecture “Can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?” I realized that I was already aware of every action mentioned by professor Ken in this video, including moving to a co-housing area in a city, take public transportation, switch to a plant-based diet, and in general consume less. However, in the past, if someone who knows little or even nothing about climate crisis and ask me about some advice of actions to take in order to lessen the environmental damage of our daily lives, I would be hesitant to make the above suggestions because I would consider them as minor solutions to carry out in our lives. But watching this video makes me realize that the importance of taking actions actually lies right in these tiny moves. It is these daily things that can really make a difference, so I think one thing our generation should so is to have faith in these steps and that they will finally build up to make some changes to our environment. And as professor Ken mentioned in the second lecture video “What the Boomer generation knew about the climate crisis - and when we knew it”, the last generation did know about the climate crisis and the detrimental effects of human actions like oil drilling, but what was the reason they didn’t make a difference? My guess is that the major difference between our generation and the last generation who failed to make improvements is going to be because we firmly believe that through the subtlest and easiest ways of reducing carbon footprint, we can save the planet.

After watching “can one generation do what previous generations failed to do?”, I learn that some easy ways for our generation to change to reducing carbon emissions. First, transportation can shift from cars to walking or biking or moving to a single apartment. Moving to a city, wasting less food, and having no more than one child can help to save the earth. The video tells me that we can start with simple things. 
<br><br>

Plus, after watching the second video “what the boomer generation knew about the climate crisis”, I see what ken said: “they knew what happened and climate crisis is important but they didn’t change.” I am not surprised because most of the time, people always realize that they are wrong but feel lazy or not motivated to change, which means to get rid of the comfort zone. I hope that the older generation can start to change from simple things and our generation can learn and continue to change and promote reducing carbon emissions.

I agree with you that the first video inspired me by showing me simple ways that I can change my lifestyle. Small changes like buying used clothing and shifting to a plant based diet are already very doable. One suggestion that I feel will be a little bit harder to achieve is reducing house sizes. In the US I feel like many many people want to achieve what their parents had and more. Both of my parents are immigrants to the United States, and they have always told me that they want me to have more than they did, and that my children should have more than I do. Although this is a nice sentiment, it can be harmful to the environment when often times people grow up to make more money than their parents, buy bigger homes, and buy more things they don’t need. The way that this can be combatted is by stopping the trend of tying “success” to “more stuff”. I think a lot of younger generations will lead more conservative/environmentally friendly lifestyles because they realize that wealth and success do not have to be flashed around by purchasing unnecessary things. 
<br><br>

I also agree with what you said about older generations remaining in their comfort zones. I think it can be scary to imagine that your generation has nearly irrevocably damaged the earth. It is especially daunting to our generation because boomers will continue to live for at least 20 more years, and continue to output a large carbon footprint.

After this lecture video, I was glad to see that I have already contributed to reducing my climate footprint. I have a really positive outlook after realizing that the five things that could help reduce our climate footprint aren’t difficult to consider, but in some places are difficult to achieve.
<br><br>
I think Santa Barbara, specifically the area around our campus, has the perfect environment in which you can adapt to these five categories. Public transportation is easily accessible, bike use is highly encouraged, housing is most likely shared, there are many locations in which plant-based food is available, and there are not many big businesses around. I do believe this benefit we are granted is because we are in a university and many are aware of the importance of our environment and have contributed to it based on these ideas. 
<br><br>

As Ken mentioned, our generation is very positive about this movement and are surprised that these five things, that an individual can contribute to, can have a large impact.  The opinions given by the older generations were not a surprise. Specifically, the comment that adaption to the five categories is an ‘assault to the American way of life’ really had me reflect on our consumer culture which was also discussed. From my personal experience and my parents’ opinions, I now feel the need to introduce them to the issue. They always encourage success in the terms of being able to have what they have “and much more”; this shows the consumer culture in which most of our population has adapted to. I  know that we can do what previous generations failed to do and also spread the word on the importance of this matter.

After these lecture videos I was also relieved to see that I have already contributed to reducing my carbon footprint. From my perspective these changes are something that anyone could implement in their daily lives and they do not seem like such a hardship. I do not have a car here, so I usually take the bus or walk wherever I need to go and I live with multiple people and I do not see that changing anytime soon. However, listening to the opinions that Ken has said that he hears a lot from older generations, I hear this from not only older generations but from others my age who want more and more. This is a shared sentiment through generations because it is a view that many envision as a successful life especially in America because many want that "American Dream" which many can take as a life of "bigger is better" and just a life in excess. But I am hopeful that this view changes as more people are educated to what is happening to the globe as well as the speed of the climate crisis.


<br><hr>
I agree with you while watching this I felt a wave of relief as I heard the five things and thought, “Oh I can do that!” or “I'm already doing that”. As you said, I think living here in SB makes it much easier to live this way but a majority of people do not live like we do here. Here, I can bike to class or take the bus to go downtown and I live in an apartment with four other people. But when I go back home, using a bike is not an option because we don’t have bike paths and cars never respect the bikers. My house is much bigger than my apartment I share with others and it's only my mom and two brothers at home. Not ridiculous big but I mean a majority of houses in California are that standard size and when I think about it, it may be too much for just a family but that is still how we all live. Here in SB, I live near a church that takes compost for their garden so I can walk over there with my bucket and that helps decrease the food waste. And I agree with you that we are privileged to live in a place who does this. As for the kids, I barely want one so I think that should help. A majority of students here may think the same since it’s well known that the higher education a person has, the fewer children they have.

I agree with your comment on the consumer culture and I think that is going to be so much harder to change for a lot of people. Celebrities and all the wealthy that people aspire to be always show off their ridiculously big mansions and all of the things they can buy and now having all that is a symbol for people.

<br><hr>
I couldn’t agree more! When Ken mentioned different generations will view these 5 ways to reduce our carbon footprint differently, I immediately thought of some family members of mine. In my family, there are some who also have that same mentally regarding success and material things. I feel like it's my job to inform them as well on the issue and gain them to view this differently. It sure will be harder for those who feel this way to change their lifestyle.
<br><br>

I was also surprised to see how much I have already been reducing my carbon footprint. Nowadays, our generation seems to be eco-friendly in that many see buying reused clothes as a trendy and easy source of fashion. I myself personally love to thrift shop and limit the number of new clothes I buy. Many people I have met also choose to do the same. I try to go as much as I can to a local thrift store and encourage my friends to come along and do the same.
<br><br>

Living in Santa Barbara has made it easier to limit my carbon emission in that I walk or choose to take the bus in order to get where I need to. As you mentioned, it is easier for us living at a university where there are many options to live a plant-based diet and commute to campus and other places without a car. Although these changes could be seen as huge transitions to some, I myself have found them very easy and convenient to do.

<br><hr>
I couldn't agree more! When he began to list the five categories to reduce our carbon footprint, all I could think was, "Oh.... Oh dang I am already doing some of these things or planning to do some of these things." I do not have a car, I use either the bus or walk from place to place, I do not want any children in the future, and I try to use all my clothing items for as long as possible or go thrift shopping. Even if I have clothes I do not use, I aim for donating those clothes to charity since I know it will be more beneficial for those who need them. I honestly find it shocking how the consumer culture have influenced many of us, I being one of the many, to think buying brand new things are "better" for us. I can remember all the times my dad urged me to by new clothes from the mall because reusing my old clothes and accepting hand-me-downs from my siblings is seen as "unkempt". Looking back at it, I can see why he had this mentality, especially since he came from a 3rd world country where nice and sufficient clothing is almost a luxury. But at the same time, I cannot help but feel disgusted that he gave in into this ideal that "newer" stuff will be always be better. My mom however, was the one who taught me the importance of buying used clothes and donating the ones you do not need. Sadly, even when I ask her, "Oh that's a cute sweater! Where did you get it?" she would seem embarrassed and say she got it from Goodwill, then proceeds to tell me, "Don't tell anyone I got it from Goodwill". She has even been influenced by the idea that buying already used clothing is seen as "poor" or "cheap", and our society fuels that mentality. I do hope our generation can fix the issue of consumer culture and make it so that buying items from the thrift store is NOT a sign of economic class, that way it is another step towards helping our plant and our carbon footprint.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that our campus is very good for reducing our carbon footprint. Everything is close enough for us to walk or bike to and the bus is free for students to ride whenever. Downtown shopping has a few thrift stores around. Almost all of the housing on campus is shared and the dining halls feature a great variety of vegan and vegetarian food. 
<br><br>
While watching this video I realized that I could follow through with the 5 changes. I already walk everywhere and if I need to go anywhere far I take the bus. I try my best to eat as little meat as possible but sometimes it is hard because I am such a picky eater. I try to waste as little food as possible by not getting big servings. I also really like thrift shopping, so I'm glad to know that I'm helping out the environment by doing so. 
<br><br>
I don't understand why the older generations have such a hard time changing their ways. It's not like we are asking for a lot. It wouldn't be hard to go without meat for a few days each day. We aren't asking them to change their entire lifestyle. We are simply asking them to buy less and waste less. America shouldn't be releasing this much carbon into the atmosphere considering the size of our population.
<br><hr>

I agree with what you said about our own community in Santa Barbara. At the university and outside in neighboring areas like Isla Vista, many people are driven by the five ways in order to reduce their carbon footprint. In even just considering the options we have for food at the university. There is food that supports plant based diets. We can look at this by just thinking about Green Monday at the university dining commons, with the purpose of cutting off meat at least once a week. After reading your comment and reflecting on this video, I feel fortunate to be part of this community that provides me with the opportunities to reduce my carbon footprint. I would also like to add on to what you said about some places having it difficult to achieve these five steps. We should always consider the countries that do not have access to altering their way of life to save the planet, whether it is through economic, cultural, or other factors. 
<br><br>

I also found it important how you emphasize through your comment the importance of educating the previous generations about the climate crisis. We have the tools and the knowledge that they need in order to compact the issue. I truly believe that if we were to introduce these five steps the average  carbon footprint can be reduced.

After watching the two lecture videos for this week, I again felt this familiar sense of helplessness in regards to the issue of climate change, but the only difference now is that I also began to see hope and feel this sense of empowerment that hopefully, it is still not too late for us to take actions to save our environment and mitigate the climate crisis. The first lecture video on what the later generations can do that the previous generations had failed to do was very informational, helpful, and even encouraging in a way that it explains steps and actions our generation specifically can do to remediate the damages done to the planet mainly by the previous parental generations. The five points Key listed out in the video cover a wide range of topics from transportation, diet, housing, the world population to daily consumption of goods and they sound like they are really effective approaches that us as individuals can take to help save our environment and those steps are not very difficult to achieve either. In fact, we can incorporate those suggestions into our daily lives, such as biking, walking, or taking the bus to work instead of driving, going on a vegetarian and largely plant-based diet, and visit thrift stores for clothing rather than shopping for new clothes, which is a great idea because I actually very much enjoy the process of thrifting. 

<br><br>

The generational divide Ken brought about in the same lecture video is also very intriguing because it is interesting to see how different and even contrasting the reactions of different generations to the abovementioned five tips on reducing our personal carbon footprints on the planet. For instance, my generation of Millenials are much more open-minded and accepting of those five suggestions and we are more alarmed and aware of the issue of climate change comparing to our parents or older parental generations. In fact, many of us are probably already implementing some if not all of the five bullet points listed by Ken on protecting our environment and preventing climate change, such as a good number of people are vegetarian and the reason they turned to be vegetarian is the harmful impacts of eating meat on the environment as well as the inhumane cruel treatments the meat industries implement towards the animals and livestock; many people, like myself, enjoy and even prefer thrifting for clothes rather than buying new pieces of clothes; and a lot of us are not objected to the idea of living in micro-apartments or taking the bus or biking to school or work. 

<br><br>

On the contrary, if the same five points are presented to our parents or even earlier generations, they probably will have very different reactions from those of us that many of them will be infuriated and offended at the suggestion of even moving into houses slightly smaller than the ones they currently own, not even mentioning the idea of abandoning their car and switching to taking the bus to work. Many of them will scoff at the idea of taking meat particularly beef out of their food menu since beef is so deeply ingrained into the American culture and it represents a sense of status, taste, and power such as through steak and other beef-related courses. 

<br><br>

This propels me to think of the reasons behind such conflicting and contrasting opinions towards climate change between the two generations. Connecting with the climate skepticism work reading assignment for this week, I think I can make a reasonable explanation for the reluctance of the older generations to accept and take action regarding climate change, and that explanation is education, cultural values, and habitual practices. The older parental generation is mostly immersed in education on climate denialism that they are somehow taught to think of climate change as a non-existent issue or an issue that does not have much of an impact on humans and on the planet. Cultural values also play a big role in that the older generation is very much convinced by and affected by the typical American Way of Life thinking that they have the right and deserve all the finest things in life after their hard work, along with the concept that bigger is better for everything. In comparison, people of my generation or the Millenials have a very different if not dissimilar viewpoint on lifestyles, such as minimalism and simpler yet more efficient lifestyles. This way they have already developed a stubborn established mindset on their lives and habits and therefore it is very difficult for them to change their perceptions stemming from this particular type of culture they grew up with. What we can do as our generation of Millenials is, going back to the lecture video of last week, intergenerational communication with our parents and elders to help them realize the urgency and pressing nature of climate change and the benefits in implementing those five tips into our daily lives that can both save our environment and make our lives more simple and efficient, or that the advantages of executing those suggestions in our daily lives outweigh the disadvantages if there is any.

It's very interesting to consider what the state of our climate would be today had our grandparent's or even parent's generation decided to make systemic change regarding climate change, and significantly reduce emissions? Would CO2 emissions still be rising but at a slower rate, or would emissions be in a declining state? Had past generations decided to act, how much of the weighty burden would still be on the shoulders of today's youth? Unfortunately, we will never know, however we have the power to prevent our children and future generations from asking the same question. Coming from a suburb right outside of Portland, Oregon, I agree that life in the city is drastically different from life in the small town where I grew up and where my family still lives. Going into the city, I even sometimes found myself feeling guilty for always driving my car when there is so much mass transit available. Along with this, the fact that someone was aware of the harmful effects of CO2 over a century and a half ago truly proves that despite the fact that today's generation is the one faced with this enormous task of saving our entire planet, society has been aware of the effects of climate change for so long, and yet has done so little.

All of the suggestions that Ken lists to live a more sustainable life are extremely useful and should be done in a perfect world. However, some of them are just not practical or attainable in my opinion. For example, ditching your car is not always an option. There are some areas in the country where public transportation is just not developed enough to be used for a person's everyday life. Yes, completely ditching cars would be ideal in a utopia, but I think a more realistic "fix" would be for electric or hydrogen powered cars to take over the roads. Switching over to renewable energy will decrease CO2 emissions and also allow people to live their worldly desires. This goes hand-in-hand with Ken's comment about people not wanting to give up their mansions and estates. It is embedded into our society that expensive luxuries are a sign of success, and when people make a living, they want to show off their wealth. Thus, owning a car, especially an expensive one, is something that I don't think can be easily taken out of our culture.
<br><br>

I wish that it could be that simple to just follow all of Ken's suggestions and move towards a greener planet, but it is not as easy as it seems. Completely making this drastic switch, from ditching cars to co-living arrangements, is very similar to going swimming in an open ocean, but not knowing how to actually swim. You'll probably be able to doggy-paddle for a few minutes, but to get back to the shore you're going to need to know how to swim (or hopefully find a boat). You need to start in a kiddie-pool or your 50 meter pool at your local park or high school before you tread in the open waters of the ocean. I believe it's the same way with switching to a new lifestyle. You must practice little changes before making the big commitments, or else you'll drown (or revert back to old ways). If we can make the little steps towards sustainability first, I believe one day we can get to Ken's suggested remedies to fix our planet.

I agree with you that discarding cars is not really practical. For me, I live in a house in Goleta, near the exit 2 of freeway 217. I drive to school everyday, which costs me about 10 minutes. Actually I have tried other transportation ways before, including bikes and buses. The google map shows that it takes me 1 hour to walk to UCSB, so walking is definitely impossible. As for bikes, I find it difficult to find a parking place and there are always too many people near the bike parking places. If I take the bus, I need 40 minutes because of the poor public transportation system. The transportation approaches other than cars are just time-consuming and inconvenient. Plus, I have courses end at 9pm, and driving a car is a safe choice for me. So I just think there’s no good alternative for me to ditch my car. However, I strongly agree with Ken that we should reduce population and rethink our relationship to stuff. I admit that I have great appetite for shopping, including clothes, bags, shoes, and cosmetics. Since I had few knowledge about anthropogenic climate crisis before, Ken brings me insight that reducing unnecessary purchase could significantly help all lives on the earth. I believe that I would ponder over the climate change before I purchase stuffs in the future. 
<br><br>
    After watching both videos, I learned that we need to equip with knowledge as well as act upon it to make it powerful. Even though people in 1970s already knew that they should reduce carbon dioxide, decrease fossil fuels, restrain from meat, and they were feared if they failed to do so, they just didn’t act. Now my generation has the mission to stop the climate crisis so we should do what we can, as suggested by Ken, to live a life that brings benefit to our planet and ourselves.


<br><hr>
I agree with your comment that even though there are just 5 changes necessary to live a sustainable life, some of these are really hard adjustments for the average American. Living in a college town/ on campus it is easy to give ourselves credit for our co-housing living situations and low use of car transportation. We do not often have to drive a car because we have access to grocery stores, jobs, school, and recreational activities so close to where we live. Also, in order to afford to live in this area, most students live with more than one person. Therefore, as college students we have already checked ⅖ of these changes off the list. However, I understand why a 40 year old woman with children would not be so eager to make these changes. We live in a world where roughly 800,000 children go missing a year. As a mother, I would feel much safer driving my child to school then to let them walk or ride public transportation everyday. I also see why it would be hard for parents to go from living in a house with a backyard for their children to play in, to a smaller apartment closer to the city. I was fortunate enough to grow up in a house where there was room to run around and play; I don’t think I would be able to take that away from my kids, if they had already experienced what that environment was like. Therefore, I do not believe cars or decently sized houses are going to go away. However, I agree with Valerie that it is realistic to change the way we use cars and our houses. If all Americans began to buy electric cars and switch to renewable energy, they could make a difference while still living a comfortable life.

After watching this lecture video there are many points I agree with, however a few points that I take issue with.  Firstly, although I recognize that Ken was simply talking from his experience that may not be able to be generalized, I do not believe that most people of my generation would have the reaction he said they would when presented with what they could do about climate change.  I believe even myself or many of my peers at a college in one of the most progressive U.S. states would think that many of these lifestyle changes, not eating meat, not driving cars and living in smaller housing, are far from insignificant.  Although the Boomer generation may be much more opposed to these changes, it is not to say that my generation isn't.  And even though some of us recognize that for the world to fight the climate issue the vast majority of Americans will have to make these changes, we are still primarily concerned with our own well being and life enjoyment at the end of the day.  Simply put, even if the majority of Americans recognize these are the changes we as a collective must make to fight the climate crisis, they will be unwilling to change their behavior on a personal level.

<br><br>

I don't think that is without merit either.  It all relates back to the collective action versus free rider problem.  To put it simply think of Americans are one collective group.  Most people would consider making these drastic lifestyle changes unpleasant on a personal level and would rather not do them.  But on the societal level it is to everyone's benefit to make these changes collectively, as not doing so will greatly harm the collective in the future.  However if the vast majority of people make these changes, the minority that do not (free riders) will have both the benefits of continuing their desired lifestyle as well as not having to face the negative effects that lifestyle produces.  On the societal level everyone realizes this and because of it the vast majority of us choose to be free riders instead of making changes to our lives, ultimately doing nothing to stop the climate crisis.  
<br><br>


Although sad, this is really rational behavior from most Americans.  Even if they do make these changes, they know that the vast majority of others will not, and their personal sacrifice will ultimately be meaningless since they alone do not have the power to reverse the massive issue of climate change.  That is why I believe any significant action taken against the climate crisis has to be on the political and economic level.  If we recognize that we individually do not have the motivation to self regulate, we need to vote and be political in a way that regulates us forcefully.  A carbon tax will force Americans to not drive huge cars because of the economic impact, a tax on massive McMansions or meat products the same.  This is not a battle we can win by merely educating the American people on their climate impact, rather we need to use the vast power our government has to shape our economy in a way that will force us and our industry to be environmentally conscious.

For what the professor says on the video, I mostly agree with him. However, for some of the five tips, emm… I guess I still need some time to adjust my life, or my opinion towards life. I am not saying that that kind of life is awful or hard to live, it is just kind of unrealistic to act in here. For example, the bus time schedule is too loose for off campus students to get into classes on time. Usually bus schedules for one hour a time. Sometimes even two hours. This is highly not feasible for not having a car for off campus students, especially if they have classes on eight o’clock in the morning. Also, most of the bus shuts down before dinner time. Therefore, if students want to purchase some stuff at night, they have to call Ubers or drive their own cars, not to mention that the route of bus and subway cannot access everyplace in the city. I believe that if with higher development in technology will take care of these issues.

I agree with you. I mostly agreed with Professor Hitlner's tips for Americans to reduce their climate footprints. They are all great tips and would dramatically help undo our footprints but its just hard to take that away from someone unless laws and regulations come into play. And what I mean by "take away" is that Americans are too accustomed to their living, the use of their cars, the homes they live in, and the diet they consume. But it is not really a matter of taking away but rather we should implement this for people and we have buses and trains but it's just not as efficient as automobiles. For example, people that do not drive in the first place already use other tools like Uber or Lyft as transportation causing an increase in ridesharing. As a community, I do not think we should stray away from replacing these commodities but evolve from it. Like start going electric, using solar and wind panels.

In the video, Professor talked about how people can help make a start to solve these problem. I can think about many ways to solve these problem such as decrease the emission of CO2, however the generation before me has tried already, but they didn’t succeed. The climate crisis still exists. So, how can our generation succeed? I think we need to understand and learn about the seriousness of the problem. We need to see the information or being educated. If everyone of us knows the result and is willing to change our lifestyle to protect our nature. As professor says, we can reduce our carbon footprint by keeping less home, reduce our sue of transportation such as cars, move to an more efficient home, etc. Many of us appreciate a bigger house and maybe a sport car. We didn’t really realize how the climate crisis will end the earth. But if we did our action late to protect the earth, it will be too late to take action.

I always wondered how we allowed climate change to become a climate crisis. There were numerous warnings throughout history (4/5 of the mass extinctions in human history were caused by climate change), and we knew from long ago that our resource consumption was polluting the environment. We are constantly given more and more evidence supporting the idea that our emissions are causing undesired effects, from increasing natural disaster severity and frequency to sea level rise and ocean acidification. Yet, we continuously turn a blind eye to these warning signs. 
 <br><br>

After watching this lecture, the reason is obvious; if it does not affect us directly, we do not care. It is easy to consume whatever we want, whenever we want, when there are no immediate consequences. But now, the consequences are catching up to us. If the effects of emissions from decades ago are only becoming apparent now, what is going to happen in 30, 40, 50 years? We are emitting more greenhouse gases than ever before. Our population is the highest that it has ever been and is only expanding. The negative effects of climate change are already heavily present and only making the crisis more difficult to mitigate. Imagine the devastation that we are currently fabricating for our future. 
<br><br>
 
This reminds me of Ken’s quote from video lecture number 5: “If not acted upon, knowledge is power squandered.” This has now become one of my favorite quotes, and I believe it is one of the most fitting ideas in this whole situation. Knowledge is not power; we know (and have known) that our consumption habits are only negative in the long run. Yet, we continue to ignore our wrongdoings. 
<br><br>
 
It really makes me wonder, though, how have we stopped problematic human practices in the past? For example, the smoking of cigarettes. Everyone used to do it. But once the evidence came out that they were extremely deadly, people stopped. It took effort, yes, but the majority of people quit. More recently, when it came out that electronic cigarettes contain deadly chemicals, the news was everywhere, and people worked hard toward making a change. Why is the same situation not the case for the climate crisis? There is SUFFICIENT scientific evidence that our customs are detrimental to our planet, and therefore, to us. So why can’t we change our ways? Are we so addicted to our “easy”, convenient lifestyles that we are willing to risk every single life on this earth? People need to realize that just because our consumption habits are not DIRECTLY affecting our health (like cigarettes), we are negatively affecting every piece of life that contributes to our health. 
<br><br>
 
It is already too late to stop climate change. Climate change is not something in our future, it is something that we are experiencing here and now, every single day. It cannot be undone, only diminished. We need to work hard to avoid even more severe consequences than those that are occurring now. But, just like Ken’s generation did not see the immediate effects caused by their emissions and consumption, we cannot see the effects caused by our generation. They are hiding in our future, and will only get more severe unless we do something, and do it quickly.

The emphasis of conveniency posed in this comment is so relevant to the issue of climate change. No one wants to give up their ways because it's impractical for them to start a whole new routine, or replace their old services and devices for something that will cause less damage to themselves and others. The cigarette/e-cig analogy was a perfect comparison to this as literally every person I know vapes, either not knowing that there or consequences down the line to inhaling random chemicals or not caring that they are inhaling them. Some kids have even picked up cigs to fuel their nicotine addiction because "at least it's natural." It's the same thing with the climate crisis which sucks, we have had cars for so long taking us from place to place, why would we want to ride a bike or sit on public transport with a bunch of random strangers? No one cares because we can't see it happening before our eyes. Once people started getting lung cancer and dying people finally started to take quitting smoking seriously, seems as if it will take drought, flood and fire to appear in a white suburb of Ohio for people to actually take action. For those who care, we can try as best we can to follow the 5 steps Ken offered in this video, like switching to a plant-based diet or biking/walking to class vs. driving. Our little choices can make a big difference. It's a start.

While watching the video, I realized that many people may be spending too much time on "blaming" the previous generations. Almost disregarding that our generation as well has added to a good portion of pollution. Yes we were not aware of it because we were small children, but still, we were still part of the problem. So can one generation fix what the last generation did? I strongly believe so. When Ken described in the lecture many different ways to reduce our climate footprint on the planet, I also began to ponder the easy steps each of us could take on a daily basis. Although these strategies seem like it will not actually make a difference, it clearly does. Not only will it take proper education about climate change to the populations of the world and America who do not fully understand the concept, but it will also take removing the stigma that "I won't make that big of a difference just because I am going vegan or not driving my car". It will make a difference and is an extremely desirable goal for many people. It is dissapointing that the above generations were not able to erase the stigma and are part of contributing to the culture of lavish living and excess indulgence. 
<br><br>


So why does this generation react so differently to climate change than older ones? It seems like the older generations would be able to recognize the changes that have been taking place over the years they have been alive. But instead the improved technology and conveniecne that we have become so accustomed to leads to an increase in pollution and climate change, something we refuse to accept. Yes technology is great and can even solve enviromental issues, but it also is the cause of so much destruction and corruption within the big business bubble. The generation above us has instilled the gross habit of denying our contribution to climate change, and more importantly has instilled the idea that it is "too late anyway".

Can our generation do what previous generation failed to do? My answer to this question is ‘yes’ but I am afraid that probably some people will ask ‘why?.’ There is an idea come up in my mind: Is the previous generation failed to do it?
<br><br>
50 years ago, the Earth doesn’t have as much high-tech as it has today. With far less high-tech, humans produced far less pollution to the Earth compare to technology. Then the previous generation started to raising kids. They wants to give their best to the new generation. High-tech pops up. People’s lives become much better. Surely the process of producing technology creates a lot of pollution, but why the previous generation do that, bearing the risk of polluting the Earth and yelled by Greta Thunberg? (I am not going to continue or answer this question)
<br><br>
Now, luckily, the new generation realize that they should protect the Earth (people born in the 80s and the 90s who are currently working). They try their best to produce much better high-tech that will not pollute the Earth.
<br><br>
At the same time, not only high-tech, but also lifestyles can impact the environment.

Your aspect of looking at this problem inspires me. Many people blame the previous generation for exploiting our environment and causing a series of problem such as global warming and climate change. Indeed, the consequences they caused is serious. But in the previous generations, people seek for prosperity and seek the convenience of human, many countries were on their way from developing country to developed country, which high carbon emission is inevitable. In the previous generations, people are educated to pursue freedom and the prosperity of individuals. As a result, the answers from previous generations that Ken mentioned in the lecture, such as “We are free to eat what we want, to live where we want,” etc., is understandable. The climate crisis at that time was not perceived as such a fatal problem as it is now, and due to the misleading information by some politicians and fake scientists, many common people are not even accessible to details, leaving “climate crisis” just a vague concept in people’s eyes. They have used to their self-interest and high carbon emission lifestyle, and it is admittedly difficult to change their point of view from the past. 
<br><br>
Our previous generations might have failed to protect our environment from human activities, and they have left us with a lot of environmental issues, but together with advanced technology and great inventions that provide convenience. Instead of scolding them, it is more important for our generation to take on the responsibility of slowing down global warming and climate change. What Ken has mentioned in the lecture are very approachable ways of reducing our carbon footprint. Besides driving less and changing diet, there are also some other things we can do to protect the environment, such as reducing the times that we open our refrigerator daily and setting air conditioners 1 degree higher during summer. These decrease the fluorine emission, which is also a major cause of global warming. Moreover, one of the most important issues is to lower the cost of utilizing renewable resources, so that they can replace carbon as the most desirable power resources. So, encouraging students to choose majors relating to new resources or environment could also help. The duty of protecting the environment has fallen upon our generation, and we must not leave an inhabitable planet for the next.

It is necessary to say this: A Chinese scientist has said this, that I want to share with everybody. ‘We are not saving the Earth. The Earth is not dying and it doesn’t need us to save. We need to save ourselves.’ He is right. If the Earth wants to be naughty, more and more tsunami and earthquake will only hurt human beings. After the tsunami and earthquake, the Earth is still the Earth, but there will be major change in human populations and life.
<br><br>
In terms of college students choosing majors, I noticed that UCSB has a comparatively good Environmental Studies major. This major offers a lot of courses, which is even more than UCSB’s Global Studies major. It is doable for college students to try to major in Environmental Studies, so that they will know what is happening on Earth.

I think a handful of people know that we need to help reduce our individual carbon footprints, but a lot of these people do not know the necessary steps to take. I think this lecture video does a great job at highlighting the 5 important steps that we need to take to reduce our carbon footprint, and I was not aware of all these myself. The first one was pretty obvious to me, and this was transportation. Transportation counts for ¼ of an individual's carbon footprint which I find crazy. It makes so much sense that it counts for this much because of how often we drive cars. A lot of people don’t realize the harm that cars cause to our planet because driving is something almost everyone does everyday. Driving is part of our lifestyle which is why I find this step the hardest to change. The second step is housing and this is something I never really thought about. Typically people live in pretty big houses that can hold their whole family. I come from a family of 8 (combined family) so we have to have a bigger house to hold all of us. Growing up in Orange County, I thought bigger houses were the norm because that's all I've ever known. However, I now realize that these bigger houses are ridiculous for a small family of 4 to live in. I can now see why switching to smaller houses/apartments are a necessary step to take if we want to reduce carbon emissions as a whole. 
<br><br>
I personally believe one of the most important steps for Americans to take is to reduce our average purchases per year. The amount of stuff we purchase on the daily is absolutely ridiculous and I am personally trying to cut back on these purchases myself. In high school, I found myself shopping a lot (especially when I was bored), and I never realized my consumption of goods was an issue until now. I didn’t realize the true harm these purchases place on the planet itself. Not only am I frustrated by this consumer culture, but many other students are as well as stated by Ken. I think my generation has a pretty bad issue with the consumption of goods, but I believe we are slowly getting better with the idea of thrift shopping.

It is a well known fact that American life is one of luxury and consumption. And for many, the thought of being forced to change their lifestyle is unsettling, even daunting. But when it comes down to it, the prosperity of our generation and the ones to come after us should be more important than maintaining a consumerist way of life. The five suggestions Ken mentioned in this video are greatly effective for reducing one’s carbon footprint, but many people are not ready to make that jump. I think taking baby steps towards living a more sustainable lifestyle is the most realistic way to bring about this change. Many people, especially college students, are not the position to uproot their lives to move to a city for environmental reasons, but that does not mean that all efforts should be abandoned. Focus on the things you can do. If becoming completely vegan or vegetarian seems too hard, start with Meatless Monday or cutting down on beef consumption. Maybe carpool to work, or take public transportation a few days of the week. While it is important to be continually moving towards a more sustainable lifestyle, constantly making smaller steps towards that goal makes it seem more manageable, and more reasonable.

The problem I see with our generation and especially in places like California, is privilege and entitlement. It was not a good sight to see that all the comments about the fire, and in general about all the content we are commenting on, are in their majority emotional responses. People wanna share how they feel, because people are used to feeling important. In the grand scheme of things, I think if people really deeply cared about what is happening they would not speak about how they feel. They would speak about ideas, solutions, suggestions and actions. 
<br><br>

Unfortunately I do not see that happening between the mainstream generation of Americans. I wonder how many of these emotional people really are following a plant based diet or made other concerted efforts to address the problems. I'm sure a lot of them would say they experimented with plants but ultimately couldn't do it. So first you say you are devastated and sad and whatnot, then you say you know what the right thing is, and then you decide not to do it because you like meat too much, doesn't that sound ridiculous? 
<br><br>

Of course it's ridiculous, because emotions fade. They get lost, they are fluid and move back and forth, that's why they're called eMOTIONS. That's why I think logic and addressing the issues is so important and whatever is not in this category is pretentious. As an international student I have to say I love America, it is probably the greatest, most innovative and developed country in the world right now. But I fear that this privilege is what is holding back Americans from really actually caring and taking concrete action. Now that we all know how we feel about the climate crisis let's just please stop talking about emotions and start talking about actions and solutions.

While I agree with you that privilege plays an important role as to why nothing seems to be getting done when it comes to the climate crisis, I have to disagree about the importance of emotions. You say that it wasn't a good sight to see that the fire in paradise caused people to feel emotional...I would be very worried if this film did not invoke some sense of emotion...additionally, I think one of the main reasons climate deniers are in denial is because they lack the emotional concept of the climate crisis. They stick to facts and beliefs outside of emotions. They don't consider the human lives being affected...I would have to argue that sympathy and empathy, in my opinion, has to be one of the most important ingredients in the recipe of getting a movement going when it comes to the climate crisis. As a former climate change denier, I can honestly say my movement to a plant-based diet and the choice to try and live a better life in regards to the climate crisis didn't come from statistics, science, debates...it came from my EMOTIONS. Lastly, I think a lot of us felt "emotional" when watching the film because that's all we can feel. We don't have first-hand experience with losing a loved one or a home due to a fire, so we are left to feel sympathy which in my opinion, is something a movement cannot gain momentum without.
<br><hr>
 thank you for your great reply. I appreciate your perspective and do not disagree with it, and also respect your efforts to live a more sustainable life. I think I may have failed to expressed what I really meant in the correct manner. My problem was not with being emotional, but with the responses themselves. Of course scenes like those in paradise should invoke emotion, but when it comes to start writing, better to have less emotion and more substance. I do acknowledge that emotion is an important part of any movement, but in a class with 800 smart educated people I wished there was more substance than feelings in the comments themselves. thanks again for your thoughtful reply.

In the lecture, professor suggested several things that the young generation can do to decrease their carbon foot prints and contribute to the environment. In order to cut the carbon foot print, the professor mentioned, is to simply have house with less area, take more public transportation, have less children, try less meat and have the amount of foods that just enough to make you feel full. I do admit that those sound very easy for younger generations to achieve, however, I hold a Pessimistic view toward this. I believe that those solutions are deeply related to one’s well-being and it is hard for them to do this without sacrifice their own interests. 
<br><br>


For many people in many countries, having a big house, a car, living in a less crowded area and to eat as many as they want is the major goal for their life, and if there is someone tells them to abandon those dreams and to live in a life what the professor have suggested, there is no wonder for them to stand up against it. The history told us that people tend to keep destroying the environment as long as they can get benefits from it. If there is no restriction to regulate this phenomenon, and only depends on some voluntary actions of a small group of people, then there is no way for the environment to get better.

I’ve always been fond of the idea of having a smaller home. At first, this idea was not sparked by environmentalism but rather the image of a closer family bond created by the limited space and its coziness from within. However, now having the knowledge of how changing into a smaller living space could benefit the environment by a large margin with the implication of the second lecture video that knowledge is only power when acted upon. Even if I can’t convince my mom to move out of a two-story house, I will be living in an apartment for sure in the future. Personally, I rather put the cost of living into greater use. Not because I would have less space to clean, but I could use that money to improve my diet since the majority of “healthy” food is still on the higher price range. I think changing the method of transportation is also a great way to act if you think about it for health reasons. Riding a bike to work, walking to school, or taking a rideshare instead of driving your own car would not only help you save time from finding parking or even worry about putting gas in for the car. I believe that small changes that we do daily can have a bigger impact than signing a “deal” of some sort.

I am ashamed that the United States accounts for only four percent of the world’s population, yet emits a whopping twenty-five percent of total atmospheric greenhouse gases. This is a direct result of American’s desire for meat and stuff. I was shocked to learn that in 1950, the average size of an American house was under 1,000 square feet, however, today the average size of an American house is over 2,500 feet. Moreover, ten percent of newly constructed American houses are over 4,000 square feet. Americans typically justify their enormous houses filled with unnecessary materialistic items with the motto “bigger is better”. Nonetheless, more and more people are finally realizing that bigger is not better, especially for the environment. 
<br><br>


Even though younger generations are more aware of the impacts of their lifestyles, I think it is naive to think that our generation will take steps to sufficiently fight the climate crisis. We cannot expect younger generations to embrace sweeping change when past generations failed to do so. Especially when we were raised in environments where we could order something on Amazon or another online website in a matter of minutes. When the vast majority of celebrities use their status to flaunt their wealth and encourage their followers to purchase the next “coolest” thing. When we are constantly bombarded with advertisements encouraging us to buy items that will make us happier or more popular or loved. When our society defines wealth as success. I believe that in order for my generation to make the necessary changes to their lifestyles required to fight the climate crisis, our materialistic culture must change. 
<br><br>


We are aware that we need to change our lifestyles, but just as Ken said in the other lecture, knowledge is not power. For knowledge to become powerful, we must act on it. I am excited for us to learn more about possible solutions to the climate crisis and then take action with that knowledge.




</p><hr>


<p>

Although the other lecture was very impactful, especially in regards to finding power by acting upon the knowledge you already possess, I chose to comment on this lecture because my observations of the world really match with his. I took this class for two reasons. 1) I wanted to know everything I could possibly do to personally combat climate change and I wanted to know which actions would be most impactful. 2) Since I want to pursue a career in politics, I wanted to know how to most efficiently and effectively make climate change legislation and convince people that such legislation NEEDS to pass. Because of this, I was also surprised that I only needed to do these 5 things to dramatically curb my carbon emissions. These things are very easy and I am already doing many of them. This is partly because I am a young person who is constantly worried about the climate crisis, but also because of my mother.
<br><br>

 I appreciate Ken addressing that the ratio of population to consumption is very important to consider. My mom is environmentally friendly not because of her age (she was born in 1965), but because she grew up in El Salvador and the culture there is very different (and actually much more environmentally friendly) there than in the US. I am vegetarian (trying to become vegan) and my mom has been vegetarian for several decades. Eating meat was more of a luxury in El Salvador saved for special occasions like Christmas, birthdays, and anniversaries. Many Salvadoran dishes are vegetarian (they are only meat-heavy in the US to appeal to an American audience). El Salvador is also not a nation of fast fashion. It is not uncommon for my mom to wear clothing today that is older than I am. It is not because she's gross or cheap, but it is because Americans take pride in things that people from El Salvador don't take pride in. People in El Salvador take pride in taking care of things and keeping them in great conditions for a very long time because it shows respect for your community and what you have. People keep their things nice and in good conditions because they take pride in themselves and what they have. It is truly a Western concept to take pride in having a lot of stuff, even if that stuff is cheap and poorly taken care of. That's why it doesn't seem strange to me to keep clothes for a life time. If you take pride in what you have and therefore take care of what you have, your clothes can look good as new for decades--this is also because things are made with love an quality since cheaply making as many things as possible is not a goal. People in El Salvador would much rather have one very nice outfit (that'll last a life time) than hundreds of cheap clothes. Because of this, it is not difficult for me to do the 5 things in the video. 
<br><br>

Because of my experiences I think it is not only important to address the generational divide with climate change, but the cultural divide as well.

I actually think your perspective and inclusion of your own background culture in El Salvador brings a very relevant and impact point to the climate crisis. Climate crisis is not only a generational issue, but is also a cultural issue. 
<br><br>
Just as it was repeatedly mentioned, although the US is the richest country in the world (and therefore should have the most power to solve the climate crisis with its influence and money), it is the biggest climate polluter in the world. This is mostly due to US culture.
<br><br>

As a culture in the US, it is overly focused on consumer culture and the notion that "bigger is better". The economy is revolves around making things easier for consumers, without actually considering the backhanded consequences on the environment. Easy to-go boxes, packaging that use one-use plastics (even some that wrap more plastic around fruits with natural wrapping), plastic bags (although now banned in CA grocery stores), plastic water bottles all severely hurt the environment. The US is also the biggest consumer of the plastic water bottle industry, an relatively new industry that lies about being better than tap water, spending over $100 billion per year. 
<br><br>
In contrast, Sweden has become the first fossil-fuel free nation, and many others vow to do the same. Other countries have also implemented a nation-wide  intensive recycling and reuse program for climate change. 
<br><br>
Therefore, I think that although the 5 steps listed sounds fairly easy, it does change quite a bit of culture, and therefore is why we have not been seeing impactful change.



<br><Hr>

I really enjoyed your comment. We need to turn to other cultures' ways and become more like them. After all, most countries emit FAR less greenhouse gases than the US does. If we could all work to be more like them, we may stand a chance at mitigating this crisis.

<br><Hr>
I can definitely relate to the cultural differences that you must've also felt between that of your parents and that of American society. My parents are from India, and more specifically a state where all of the food is vegetarian and people live such simple lives in comparison to their counterparts here in the US. Therefore, when I grew up in the US being raised vegetarian, it was almost like living in a completely different world. All of my friends would enjoy McDonald's chicken nuggets or In-n-out burgers and I almost felt like i was an outsider in terms of adjusting to the food here. While I've stayed vegetarian, there is definitely a lack of real vegetarian food in American culture that makes it hard for anyone who grew up eating meat to even consider to switch to. For example, at the dining halls on campus, most of the vegetarian food is usually just pizza, pasta, burgers, etc, making it a really bad portrayal of what good vegetarian food can look like. 
<br><br>


Apart from the diets, I also can relate to your mom's habit of wearing something until it is truly been used. Many of me and my sisters clothes are perfectly fine but we've grown out of them, so whenever my family visits India, we end up taking our old stuff to them since it is essentially unsued compared to what they wear. In India, its really humbling to see the true value that they put on things like nice clothes and it always resets my outlook on the consumer-culture that has been established throughout the US, especially in SoCal with places like LA being centers for media and fashion. 

<br><br>

All in all, i think you hit the nail right on the head. The reason that the US is leading carbon emissions is largely due to a cultural divide that we as a society have when compared to the rest of the world.

<br><Hr>
I loved the anecdote about your mom because it shows so clearly how it is possible to change our lifestyles and appreciate living in such a way that we help the environment. American culture has centered around eating meat, fast fashion, etc., but if we intentionally choose to change the way we live, we can have a huge positive impact on the climate crisis. If people in other countries can do it, then so can we. 
<br><br>
I was raised a vegetarian, so it’s hard for me to imagine what it would be like to give up meat, but I know it can’t be easy. However, I think most Americans can reasonably give up meat a few times a week, or like you mentioned, let it be something just for special occasions. I completely understand why the idea of going completely vegetarian or vegan is daunting but if everyone gave up meat just once per week, as one student mentioned in lecture last week, we could significantly reduce our carbon footprint. 
<br><br>
I also admire that you are already preparing yourself for a career in politics through which you can help combat the climate crisis. People in our generation have responsibility and means to put a stop to this problem. We have responsibility because if we don’t act now there’s no going back, and we have means through our power to vote. Like Professor Hiltner mentioned, changes to our modes of transportation, housing, diet, number of kids we have, and materialistic possessions can potentially reduce our carbon footprint. However, we must be intentional about these changes, we cannot just talk/dream/advocate for them otherwise nothing will change and there will once again be a generation that failed to act.






</span></div><hr>

<p>

I think a lot of people make minimal or no efforts to help further prevent the climate crisis because it seems like only extreme actions, such as activism or a drastic/inconvenient lifestyle change, will actually stop effects. However, Hiltner discusses five doable actions that we can do in order to cut our climate footprint at most in half! That’s a big impact in my opinion, which is not only beneficial to us but the entire planet. For example, his transportation and housing suggestions seemed extreme until he brought up living in the city. One of the things that I am trying to do more is wasting less food and eating less meat. Lately, I have been leaning more towards plant-based meat substitutes or no beef at all when grocery shopping. I do this not only for the environment but for a healthy diet. I also have been bringing a reusable cup/straw when I buy Starbucks. Rethinking our relationship to stuff and limiting our offsprings seems pretty easy considering how much money it would save us! 
 <br><br>
Another interesting point that Hiltner underscores is the different reactions between generations. As you can see from my response above, I fall accordingly with my generation’s first response. I believe the difference in our responses is what lead to and ultimately created the “ok boomer” meme. In other words, “ok boomer” is sort of our generation’s frustration to Hiltner’s generation’s resistance to change, which is highlighted in their primary two responses to the five things.

I definitely agree with many factors that you talked about. It does seem like people are aware of the harsh reality of climate change and feel bad about it, yet the intention to actually change something about their lives to fight this crisis isn’t really there. Ken’s 5 suggestions on how to fight climate change are reachable. To make these actions easier, we should focus on one suggestion at a time, work with it, achieve it, and then add in another action  little by little. This way our carbon footprint will reduce tremendously, even without us noticing it. If we’re being honest, people are highly influenced by society, thus a group of people who are doing these 5 actions can pave the way for others to follow. Furthermore, the suggestion of transportation and thrift shopping are, personally, the ones that I feel like anyone can follow. Being in college has allowed me to understand that we don’t need a car for everything or everywhere we go. Yes, we might need a car for things such as transporting our stuff from home to college, vice-versa, or other personal things, however for our day to day life we can simply adjust to biking, walking, car pooling, bus, etc. Even going for a hybrid car is more ideal than a traditional car. Also, the suggestion for thrift shopping is awesome because not only are we standing against fast fashion but also saving money. If we all started thrift shopping and taking good care of our clothes, then we can limit water pollution, use of toxic chemicals, and textile waste by not throwing out our clothes. Little changes like these definitely add up and make a difference. Honesty, people are just scared of losing their freedom, however doing any of these actions is not losing freedom because people have the choice to adjust their lives to be more environmentally friendly. It just depends if people like it and stick with it. We have to be more selfless and think about how our actions impact everything around us and even future generations. If we really don’t want to be like the boomer generation, it is time to start acting now.

Since the first day of class I’ve been wondering, what can I do to help stop our earth from dying? Our house is on fire, but can my little life even make a mark? I am a firm believer that every little change has an impact, no matter if it's metal straws or reusable sandwich bags. Even if I slowly reduce my meat consumption instead of cutting it out all at once, I’m still making a difference. I think one problem nowadays is that people think you need to go all out, all at once, instead of celebrating and encouraging little steps. This planet is in dire need of drastic change, but in order to get mass populations to work together, I think little steps is better than none at all. 
 <br><br>

The five steps that Ken mentions sound simple enough. Take public transportation, which is easy and very common in cities like New York. Own small homes or apartments, which once again is simple in the cities, and from a financial standpoint your paycheck shouldn’t be all wasted on housing. I’ve always hated food waste, in middle school I was the human garbage can because I would eat food my friends didn’t want, and most of it was untouched (one of my friends threw away the sandwiches her mom made her without even opening them, every single day). Personally, a plant based diet had previously seemed impossible to me. I’ve always been a huge meat eater, and I thought I’d never change. This class has already made me change. I don’t eat nearly as much beef as I used to, and I’m hoping to completely cut it out in a few months. The children part really gets me, I’ve always wanted a big family. Yet, I don’t know what the future holds and 1-2 children would be much simpler when I have my career. Unfortunately many thrift stores nowadays are expensive because it’s become a fad among the ‘cool’ kids, but I know some that still sell clothes at very cheap prices and I will begin to shop there more than before. 
 <br><br>

Unfortunately, the generation gap still exists. Older generations are usually more stubborn; they don’t want to change the way they live, and they don’t want to take the blame for basically causing the climate change catastrophe we have now, so most of them deny its happening at all. As shown in Ken’s other video (“What the Boomer generation knew about the climate crisis-and when we knew it”) Americans have known as early as (at least as early as) the 1970s, and yet they continued to do what they knew was wrong. I love what Ken ends the video with, knowledge is power but only when acted upon. My generation must act upon what we know.

I had similar feelings after the first classes of English 23. I wanted to know what I could do right now to help reverse the effects of climate crisis. Watching the graphic film about the fire in Paradise, I felt like I had a responsibility I owed to Earth. The everyday solutions that Ken mentions in the video lecture seems doable. He is right, when he stated the five things we can do, my initial reaction was, “That’s it?! It seems too easy.” Though these steps seem like a feasible change to some, it is not a feasible change to everyone. We need to get more people thinking about the changes Ken mentions.
 <br><br>

I respect your insight on your personal life about the five changes. I agree that transportation and housing is a major part of our carbon footprint. While public transportation is a great solution to lowering carbon footprints, I don’t think there are enough cities that have reliable public transportation. I live in suburban city and cars are the most efficient way to get around by far. Yes, there are better modes of eco-friendly transportation that exist (walking, biking, train, etc.), but it is not efficient in most cities. Even Los Angeles, one of the biggest cities in the United States, does not have dependable public transportation system. Not every city is built like New York City with subways on every block. To successfully lower transportation emissions, cities need to upgrade and encourage the use of public transportation.
 <br><br>


Thrifting has become a recent hobby of mine. Over the summer, my friends and I started thrifting because of its increasing popularity on social media. I enjoyed thrifting way more than I thought I would. It takes patience but it’s so satisfying in the end knowing that it helps the Earth and you got a good deal.
 <br><br>

Change can be difficult, but I am optimistic that my generation can make the changes that are needed to save our planet.



<br><hr>
We do need to get more people involved, and the steps seem simple enough but for some may be impossible. 
 <br><br>

I am actually from LA so I can tell you the public transportation there is terrible. The buses take forever and the trains cover very very little of the large city so basically no one uses it, and thus everyone drives. For my family and friends it is impossible to get around without driving, so while I know how detrimental their cars are, I cannot tell them to simply take the bus or the train, and I heavily rely on their driving as well. One of the biggest issues that cities will have to deal with is creating accessible and efficient mass transportation.

The hardest thing about this conversation we are having is that humans in America have become accustomed to a style of living that isn't sustainable. If you threatened to take away this style of living, people would be up in arms and you would experience a whole lot of backlash. Cars are a luxury that many have begun to feel entitled to. Families wouldn't be in favor of "Micro-living" because for many the American dream is owning your own home for your family rather than renting small spaces which feel "cramped" as some would say. They funny thing is, while students are in college we will readily accept riding bikes or buses and living with even 10 people because we do what we have to do with little to no money. College students get what we get and we don't throw a fit because that sense of entitlement hasn't set in with us. Once we accomplish earning a degree and finding a good job, we suddenly think that since we worked so hard we shouldn't have to continue living the way we did in college even though that is probably when we lived the most sustainably in our lives. 
 <br><br>

The issue with food is that we have evolved from hunter gather societies where meat was calorically dense and sought after. We are programmed to want to eat meat because that is what allowed us to survive and pass our genes on to the next generation during ancestral times. Our eating habits can change though. Even if we just reduce our consumption of meat it would be helpful.
 <br><br>

The population problem is rough because people don't like being told what to do. I myself hope to have two children in the future but this video states that it is better to have only one. To combat this we should educate women because that has directly correlated with women having fewer children and having them later in life when they are most likely more responsible nonetheless. 
 <br><br>

A great solution in the video, regarding consumerism in the clothing industry, Is to start thrifting. Not only is thrifting fun and much more affordable but it creates a community where clothes are reused and this is much more sustainable. This summer I got 2 pairs of American eagle shorts for $5! You can be stylish and creative without increasing your carbon footprint and spending a lot of money.

I totally agree that Americans have become ingrained with this lavish lifestyle that isn't sustainable and the mindset of entitlement. There are many people, like Ken said, who would really complain and hate the idea of this change to micro-living and not eating as much meat. Growing up in Orange County, California, I have seen the McMansion lifestyle with luxurious cars around a lot, even with some of my friends being raised in and living this lifestyle. The most important thing I have realized is that this wealth and lifestyle does not make one happy, which is why I think micro-living has a lot of promise. Personally, I am excited to live in a smaller house to live a simple lifestyle that costs less for my bank account and the planet!

 <br><br>

However, I think it'll be a tall task to change the minds of the generation in power now, as they have been living in this unsustainable American lifestyle that is ingrained into their sense of being. Asking them to change and take this away probably won't work, so it is up to my generation to make the change. I personally think the changes proposed by Ken will not only help our planet, but make us happier people in general! Living in a micro-apartment or smaller house, riding a bike (not owning a car), going thrift shopping, and shopping less will save Americans so much money - allowing them for more free time to do what they please. I also believe eating plant-based is such a good way to be in harmony with ourselves and the earth - food is sacred as something we put into our bodies and literally becomes who we are. Avoiding eating animals that have been sitting in a cage, stressed out all of their lives, is a great thing for our health and the health of the planet.


<br><hr>

I agree that in college, we are probably living the most sustainably we have ever or will ever live in our lives. In my time at college, I have definitely begun to think of how I grew up, with a car, and a nice house, as a luxury that I want to achieve post graduation. Now I can see that this luxury and idealized future is not going to help the environment, and I will likely never achieve it to the extent my parents did.
 <br><br>
I also agree that our eating habits can change and I think that the last sentence of your second paragraph is really important where you said "even if we just reduce our consumption of meat it would be helpful." I think that going along these lines and trying to get people to cut out meat for just a few days each week, there would be a huge effect on climate, and it is a more reasonable place to start than asking people to stop eating meat entirely. 
 <br><br>
Lastly, your theory on population and that it's hard because people don't like being told to do is true. I think the most important thing we can do is educate women around the world where they are less educated, because that may be able to stop women from having 5,6,7 or more kids, which I find to be hardly necessary and is clearly harmful to the environment.

After watching the two lectures, I was very encouraged on what actions to take to help better the economy and the world. Both of the videos were very educational and informative, and I really like how they were well described and  straight forward. It encouraged how we can use his generation as a  “cautionary tale” to prevent any disasters that can possibly occur in the present or future. In addition, it was very interesting how Ken went through the 5 ways to make a difference very thoroughly and it was easy to comprehend. He also explains the reasons why people would  go against his reasoning, but he gives good justification why we should put these 5 ways to make a difference in practice. I really liked how he emphasizes that we should limit what we buy and eat so that we won’t waste any food products and clothing. We should recycle things that we don’t use and donate items that we don't use them as much. It was crazy how one person at least purchases at least 6o items of clothing not counting underwear and other garments in a year. He encouraged me to keep watch on what I spend and make sure that is something that I actually use. He also emphasizes how we reduce our meat intake so that it doesn’t affect the lack of animals and survival. Overall, these videos were very informative and made me open my eyes to what other options are available to make a change to this world.

I too was encouraged and more aware of the lifestyle changes I can make to help build a more sustainable future. I found this video to be informative as professor Hiltner gives us 5 different aspects of our daily life we can help better. My takeaway from this and lecture #5 were definitely that more than anyone our generation and the ones to come have the most responsibility and knowledge towards helping our planet and making decisions that will directly attack climate change. I couldn’t agree more with the analysis on differing perspectives on lifestyle changes that older and younger generations have. I am so glad that the way people are seeing “alternative” consumption choices are no longer heavily seen as dumb or “less cool”. I have only seen an increase in people my age who choose to consume less meat, purchase less product (clothing and technology) and are more willing to implement new practices like biking as they know there are consequences to all actions. There are so many aspects we can choose to help better ourselves, society and our environment, while a lot of these changes may impose more obstacles for some of us, I like to relay this message to my friends and siblings a bit differently. Apart from explaining the many changes and their benefits towards bettering climate change I always tell people to focus on one aspect of their life they’re willing and hoping to change, maybe going vegan is appealing, or solely shopping second-hand, or commuting instead of owning a car. The list can be endless but I think focusing on one thing at a time has worked best for me, learning to take shorter showers, purchase produce without plastic packaging and carry a water bottle are all habits I taught myself at different times but can now follow through with.

transportation, housing, which can further become city-living and micro-apartment, waste less food,  having less or equal to two children, and rethink the relationship with stuffs like consume less unnecessary products are five easy forward way we can start right away to cut the carbon footprint into half. different attitudes from Ken's generation and our generation can somehow reflect our values, also whether we put the future of next generations before our own enjoyment. Not only because we have more knowledge, in other saying, be more conscious about climate change, but also we embrace the fact and pay effort to change

I do agree that these are five easy forward ways to cut our carbon footprint. Our personal values also do have an effect on whether we do decide to take action or not. I do believe that our personal values are brought up by the influence of our families. Like Ken mentioned, some people in our generation state, buying into the consumer culture, that they want everything their family has and more. I do believe that we benefit from having access to this course and should share our knowledge about this topic which makes us more conscious.

I am all for his suggestions to help stop climate change. I don’t want a big family maybe just one child or two. I’d love to move to a city with exceptional public transportation. This seems like so much fun. I would only need a car to go on trips. If I lived in a well thought out urban center I could potentially get around by walking, biking, or taking public transit. I don’t need a lot of things and I often feel the pressure to buy items because I feel the pressure from society to do so. The last suggestion for me to fully embrace is changing my diet. I’m open to the idea and I have tried the past week to go vegetarian two meals a day. It is harder than I thought. I grew up on a meat based diet so not eating it is something that I will have to conquer, but I know this a capable. 
  <br><br>
I find it so funny that older generations feel so personally attacked by these suggestions. That it goes “against the american dream.”  It is completely ridiculous. I hate how american culture is ruled by capitalism and consumer culture. I’m thankful that my parents raised me with strong ideals that shows me that there is more to a person than the amount of stuff/money/land they have. I honestly hate the older generations and wish that they would just shut their old, ignorant, hateful mouths. The world would be so much better without them.

I found this comment to be very interesting for a host of reasons. This is the main reason: this comment shows what Professor Hiltner’s five suggestions actually look like in practice. Jamison feels like he could easily follow Hiltner’s suggestions on transportation, consumption, and population and even enjoy doing so. However, he is not so enamored with the idea of a plant-based diet. Every person’s response to Hiltner’s five suggestions will be different. Many people, like Jamison, will be able to follow some suggestions but not others. Some people (although probably not that many) will be happy to follow all five suggestions. And others (probably a sizable number) will find all five suggestions to be ridiculous and impossible to follow. The thing is, this is OK. If all Americans truly listen to the message that Hiltner gives, many of them will respond by changing their habits. This will look different for each individual, for different regions of the United States, for different races of Americans, etc. At this time, any response is a positive response. We are at a breaking point and we just need to get some momentum going in the opposite direction from the one we have been moving in for the last five decades. Once grassroots momentum occurs, the lawmakers and their policies will most likely (and hopefully) follow.

I would definitely say that some of these suggestions are more attainable than others. For instance, it’s not that simple to just pack up your house and move into the city or into a smaller house. Most people purchase a house based on convenience -- Is the commute to work reasonable? Is it big enough for my family? Basically, all of these suggestions are linked in one way or another. If you follow the suggestion of having a small family and reducing the amount of stuff you own, you can live in a small house. However, maybe the smaller house is a little further to work rather than a bigger house would be. As a result, you are left with a longer commute to work, which still might increase your climate footprint. Making lifestyle changes to reduce your footprint is all opportunity costs and trade offs. It may be unreasonable to follow all 5 suggestions, but even just trying your best to achieve one goal will really help in the long run. If every person makes a small change in their daily lifestyle, the impact will be huge.
  <br><br>

But then, you’re faced with the idea of the American Dream. Most people strive for the suburban house and a life in which they can afford everything that they need. It’s important to convince people to sacrifice pieces of this dream for the good of our environment. After all, if our Earth can’t withstand the damage we are doing to it, your American Dream will be shattered anyway.

Your response is great! I mentioned in my response that some suggestions are more attainable than others, but didn't elaborate. I think the housing example you wrote about was great. There are many things that have an influence on the ways in which we choose to live and where. Yes, I also agree that the suggestions are all linked . When I heard the suggestion about moving to a city, I paused to really think about this option. As you mentioned, it is not that simple to just pack your things and go. There are many things that conflict with the suggestions, but contributing to one or more of these suggestions is a step forward.


<br><hr>
Although it is true that fulfilling all of these suggestions may be difficult and may seem inconvenient and unfair to some people, climate change has become a crisis and requires drastic changes. I do agree with you that moving houses isn’t as simple as he made it seem, but solving climate change isn’t going to be simple either. It’s going to take effort and societal change. I also don’t think Ken necessarily means people should be relocating their lives if they’ve already settled, but rather that from now on, people should consider that aspect and think about it when deciding on where to live.
  <br><br>
In my opinion, four out of the five suggestions are very reasonable and things everyone should make a short-term goal. In most cities, public transportation is accessible. And if it’s not, consider riding a bike, or if your budget allows it, buying an electric car. And if all that doesn’t seem possible, carpool. There are always ways to adapt and make an effort. When it comes to diet, I think that is an extremely easy thing people need to do. For the most part, people avoid plant-based diets because they’ve grown up eating meat, or because they’re scared they won’t get enough protein. However, as a vegetarian who used to be a competitive swimmer, I can attest to the fact that protein is no issue on a plant-based diet. I would recommend watching What The Health, which is on Netflix, to warm up to the idea of it. Another reason people avoid it is because they simply love the taste of meat, but I think that is selfish. There is something more at stake than simply your preferences. Thrift shopping and buying furniture etc at second hand stores is also something that is an easy switch. Finally, when it comes to having fewer kids, I think that isn’t much of an issue in the United States, and instead is something that needs to be adapted in developing countries. However, that can’t really be done unless women are educated and learn about birth control.
  <br><br>

I also love your point about the American Dream. It isn’t going to be achievable once the climate crisis takes full force. What needs to happen is that the American Dream needs to change. It needs to have different goals. It can no longer be aiming for a white picket fence with five kids in the house and a nice car. It needs to be shifted to have a more environmental outlook. All in all, it’s going to be hard to convince the older generation of such a change, but I think it’s very possible and is already beginning to happen with our generation. People are no longer striving for the traditional American Dream. As long as this shift on the American Dream can occur and can be kept up, and people take the suggestions Ken gives in his lecture, we will already be in a much better place when it comes to doing our individual parts in helping the crisis.
<br><hr>
I really agree with you that if every person makes a small change in their lifestyles, the impact will be huge. I always believe that this climate crisis is caused by humans, and it could only be solved by humans. In this video, Ken gives us five suggestions we can do in daily life to cut our climate footprints. Although it is hard to fulfill all of these suggestions as you said, I think we should at least try our best to do it. Number one, choosing to use public transportation, a bike, or walking instead of a car. Number two, moving to a small apartment if you live in a large suburban home. Number three, wasting less food and eat largely plant-based diet food. Number four, having no more than one child per person. Number five, buying less stuff and keep what you have longer. These five suggestions seem reasonable and accessible to me, and I am willing to do it. However, most people in Ken’s generation can’t understand these suggestions because they think these suggestions sound horrible and unfair. This is the main reason why the last generations failed to mitigate climate change. Therefore, I think our generation has much more hope to solve this climate crisis or at least stop making it worse off.
<br><hr>
I think an important point that you emphasized is the fact that moving houses isn't very simple, but solving climate change isn't going to be simple either. That's a point that we all have to keep in mind. We need to make sacrifices to help move our climate in the right direction, even if they are difficult sacrifices. There's nothing easy about solving climate change, but these 5 steps will lead us in the right direction.

I really agree with what the professor said in the lecture video that it is really easy to take those very small actions to help change the environment. Although changing the environment and stop the climate crisis is really a huge task, it should still be started from the very small actions. Fortunately, more and more people these days have already recognized the impotence of these actions. Many of the people I know started to be vegan in their life I order to protect the environment. Although, for me, it is actually pretty hard to be a vegan, there are many other choices to help the environment. For example, I choose to live in small apartment in cities and prefer to choose public transportation or bicycle in my daily live. Therefore, the point that I want to make is that there are actually many easy choices to prevent the climate crisis for us. Although there may be something that we do not like to do, there must be something else that we can do easily to help, so it is possible for everyone to take action personally to provide their little help to contribute to save the earth.
<br><br>
For the part professor said about some of the possible responds to these suggestions, I think those are definitely reasonable. The idea of climate crisis is not yet a global knowledge today in the world. There are still someone spreading the idea that the situation of the earth is still good. Although some may know the climate crisis, they may think that it should be a big problem that should not be considered by us. I think the reason why this happens is that people do not have enough information about it, so we should have more propaganda on this issue.

Most millenials and Gen-Zers are probably familiar with the tactics described in this video that will aid in lowering one’s own carbon footprint. It has become popular media and knowledge that there is a certain lifestyle or way of living that is more efficient or, similarly, less destructive than one of over consumption. Through the access of social media apps like Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to name a few, people are shown and advertised products and lifestyles that are “eco-friendly” or less wasteful, and these choices are labeled as more ethical. I think there is social pressure put on others to adapt certain environmental practices, such as avoiding fast fashion, eating a more plant-based diet, and consuming less material things. I also think that this pressure is required in developed countries, such as the U.S. Although much of my generation has contributed to the existing bulk of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, most of us are aware that we can make tangible differences with our choices, whether that be by making individual consumer choices or by pressuring elected officials to care about certain issues. 
<br><br>


You mentioned five things that we can do to lower our carbon footprints, and I think all of these options are doable and necessary, but too often do we leave out the culpable parties that constitute the base and system of carbon emissions. I do not have the whole answer when it comes to turning away from the fossil fuel industry, but I know it consists of getting rid of lobbying and profitability of such dirty processes and systems. I have to remind myself to stay positive because it seems that there are more people on the planet’s side than there are on money’s side, but it is really easy to become discouraged when selfish people are in charge and are reluctant to serve the public. It is scary to think that things are not going to change given the possibility that climate change deniers are teaching the youth absolute lies, because some people are impressionable, and anything can be confirmed. I strongly believe that the next decade will determine whether we ruin things permanently or if we can turn around and save this planet.

It is an important step to recognize the eminent danger that climate change presents to our planet and human species. However, this will never be enough. What needs to happen is a surge of action on our parts. We’re no better than the skeptics if we sit back and be angry about what the boomer generation has left my generation with. Changing our habits in areas of transportation, housing, food, family size, and reduction in consumer culture are simple changes on the surface, but the reason why people don’t just switch is because these are the core aspects of American culture. The reason I say that is because I believe it. I understand the argument that people want to enjoy the fruits of their labor. That’s what we’ve been taught our whole life. It’s always been “go to school, do good so you can get a good job so you can buy a nice house and have whatever you want.” So really, it’s not a question of whether or not we can switch our habits quickly, its whether or not we are okay with changing everything we’ve been taught since birth. 
<br><br>

With this in mind, I can say it shouldn’t be hard for my germination because most of us havent obtained the bulk of what we need to change in order to make a difference to our environment. For example, I am going to school, I would hope most of us are, I mean you’re sitting in this class. But a lot of us haven’t obtained our dream house, we aren’t even thinking about kids, and veganism is a favorable trend for many reasons. It’s not too late for us to rethink our culture and make a difference. I wouldn’t mind living in a micro apartment because in my opinion, it would seem pretty convenient. However, this seems almost impossible for the boomer generation. They’ve experienced all the these changes we need to make so its not hard to believe that they would refuse to give up their house they spent their life working for or give up buying the luxuries they enjoy everyday. So sadly, it really is up to us. I see no hope for the past generation, but judging how younger activists have stood up and made changes already I don’t think it’s too late for us.

Although it may seem pessimistic, I truly agree with you that there's no hope that the boomer generation will commit to changing their lifestyle, even if it means preserving the earth for their grandchildren. For them, it goes back to their foundation and how they grew up in a purely consumer-based society. As you said, they've been driven through life on the very idea that one day they'll have enough money to own whatever they want. Their culture has subconsciously learned to base the success of their lives on the worth of their goods. And you can't really blame them for giving in to that ideal. After all, they're only trying to do what they think is best for them. Maybe that right there is the problem. As a society, we are too selfish and that is leading us to our downfall. Global warming is like Mother Nature's way of saying she's had enough. So, as my faith is lost on the older generations to change, I just hope that our generation can make enough of a difference to make-up for their stubborn mindsets.

<br><br>
Now, my generation is burdened with this weight on our shoulders that the fate of our civilization as we know it is in our hands. And maybe, this isn't such a bad thing. As Hiltner said, "If acted upon, knowledge is power. Otherwise, knowledge is squandered." For many of us, the climate crisis has been a part of our lives since we were born. Whether it was present through extreme wildfires like we talked about last week, devastating hurricanes, signs in bathrooms telling you to turn the sink off while brushing your teeth, or some of the highest temperatures breaking in winter, it's surrounded us since day one. We can't claim ignorance as previous generations have. We honestly can't afford to because there is no planet B. We must change our lifestyles and make significantly smaller greenhouse gas footprints if we stand any chance of reversing the damage done onto our environment. Put into perspective, the five alterations that Hiltner suggests are much less harrowing than the endpoint of the path we're currently headed down. Surely we can cut down on our meat consumption and think about moving to cities where walking is the best form of transportation if it means buying us and our children an entire lifetime. Knowing that 1/2 of the average American's greenhouse gas footprint is in relation to transportation and housing, think of how much of a difference we could make.


<br><hr>
Ken listed out five things that we could do to reduce our carbon footprint and it seems super simple on paper but since these things are involved with our everyday lives, it is actually really difficult to do. I agree with the fact that these changes will be hard to make because they are core aspects of American culture: living in the suburbs in a big luxury house with expensive clothes and cars and eating out in expensive restaurants where the main course is a nicely cooked medium-rare steak. Ken’s generation was taught to live grand as America was growing economically and these things were passed down to the younger generation so that America’s reputation as a wealthy country can be maintained. These “words of wisdom” have been passed down for at least 2 or 3 generations, it’ll be so difficult to change our habits of living so comfortably. As you mentioned, I would not mind living in a micro-apartment or eating without meat or taking the bus to get around. Granted, having an abundance of food would be nice or having a car would be convenient but if it’s something that I do not NEED then I would consider not having it.

This video offered five general points that could help significantly reduce one's climate footprint. These five points addressed transportation variations, housing, food, family size, and the limiting of materialism. The first point of transportation explained that people should move to cities where cars are not needed. I think that understanding and using public transportation is extremely beneficial and highly cost effective. My family now only uses one car and we save lots of money each year by taking advantage of carpooling, trains, and metros. The next point was housing. Ken urges people to move into micro apartments which don't waste too many resources. I found this interesting because when I traveled to Copenhagen this past summer I noticed many apartments in this style. I think that this type of house is not only eco-friendly but also teaches people to be less materialistic. With less space to put things, people will spend less on unneccassary items. This will also help alleviate the crisis. 
<br><br>

As for food, Ken supports a plant based diet. This factor is already implemented in my life. The statistic that one pound of beef is as costly as producing 30 pounds of lentils still shocks me and drives more towards a plant based diet. Ken mentions some responses to these points. Many ask if those points are all it takes. I found this statement quite interesting because this shows that even though people can nearly cut their footprint in half, they still choose to live the lifestyle they want to lead. Many people feel like they're loosing their freedoms by following these steps. This is upsetting and shows how entitled some people are. I acknowledge that it may be hard to implement all these points but something is better than nothing.

Your comment on this video is comprehensive. In this video, Ken mentions five points that could help us reduce our climate footprint on the environment. These five points include transportation, housing, food, family size, and the limiting of materialism. You clarify these five points and take yourself as an example. I am happy to see that you have already taken actions to reduce your impact on global warming. Also, it is interesting to notice that people have different responses toward the issue although they know the emergency of preventing global warming. Some people choose to act immediately, while others simply live their own life. But I am not one of these people who don't care about the environment at all. So I will change.

Throughout this video, Ken was able to summarize the key things that our generation needs to do in order to begin cleaning up what past generations have left behind. The 5 main ways he expressed were through more efficient transportation (ie. mass transport), more efficient housing, eating wasteless food, having no more than one child per person and finally rethinking our relationship to material things. Consumer culture is a big problem, but trends directing people to thrifting and buying second hand clothes is becoming more and more popular and is a way to prevent material waste. 
<br><br>
I am shocked, but not surprised, of the level of environmental damage America is continuing to cause. Ken said that although family sizes are decreasing in America, the actual size of the home is increasing which makes absolutely no sense to me. Why should we need more space to live when the average family size is decreasing? It’s as if no one is making a conscious effort to save the planet and that scares me.
<br><br>
I believe that the saddest thing is that the generation before us knew that they were causing almost irreversible damage to the planet and were doing nothing to prevent it from continuing to occur. People were worried, but those feelings never translated into actions.I hope our generation doesn’t continue this trend and  will learn from the mistakes of our ancestors before time runs out.

In response to the first lecture, there were some things that seemed practical while others did not. This made me wonder how my other classmates could agree to some of these things. I did not realize that I may have some of the same opinions as the older generations. For instance, the micro apartments and community housing. I don’t think I could ever do that. I know it would greatly reduce my climate footprint, but I have dreamed of having a big house with a white picket fence my whole life. This brings me to a point that Amy brought up where families are getting smaller but their homes are getting larger. Horrible but seems very accurate. I think this is because our generation and generations above us are focusing on the American Dream. The size of your home is representative of how much money you have. It is a power thing, and unfortunately, I don’t know how you change that. On the other hand, the different modes of transportation… easy. I could for sure walk or take the bus. I mean heck, worse case scenario I would buy a Tesla or Prius. 1 kid. Absolutely not. If that became a law in the U.S., I would seriously consider moving to England. Finally, the fact that on average 60 new pieces of clothing a year is a shocking statistic. Honestly, I feel bad about myself. I shop way more than that and never considered how horrible that could be for the environment. I knew it was bad for my wallet, but the environment? At the end of the day, Americans are just spoiled. 

<br><br>
While watching the second video, I have to wonder, “is meat worse for my own body or for the whole world?” If the older generation (my parents) knew how bad eating meat was for the world, then why would they go on to raise children whose meals revolve around that one component. That’s like knowing smoking is bad, but giving your kid a pack of cigarettes in their lunch box. I just don’t get it.

In the lecture, Ken goes over the 5 lifestyle habits that one can change to reduce carbon emissions. The problem I have with this lecture is that the American people are already aware of these sustainable ways of life.  Let's be frank, Americans are not going to adopt these life-changing habits to benefit the planet. You can't just ask someone to change their means of transportation, their diet, and the housing system because it will reduce their carbon footprints. Refusing to these 5 changes does not make an individual any less humane or caring of the environment. I just don't believe we should continue promoting this specific agenda because it has been ineffective throughout generations. I currently cannot think of any other approach or way of limiting American's carbon emissions without restricting their lifestyle liberties. However, I just don't see American society putting an end to their contributions to global warming by riding a bike or living in a micro-apartment. Currently, I can say that I am vastly decreasing my carbon footprint by riding a bike every day and living in a micro-apartment with other UCSB students. That is my college lifestyle though, once I graduate and find a comfortable job I can have to sustain a good life then I continue to drive and get a different housing system. I am sorry but this is just my opinion and thoughts regarding this idea of a sustainable and eco-friendly living system.

I agree that these solutions are not as easy as they sound since the changes can interfere with a persons typical way of life. It is always going to be difficult to force change, the ideas must be adopted naturally by more Americans if we want to see a real transition. If people make the choice for themselves it will be much more readily adopted. The problem is getting Americans to see the problems with our way of life. We are deeply invested in our heavily consuming lifestyles and have been continually damaging the environment in a number of ways as a result. If the seriousness of our climate crisis was conveyed to more people then I think many more people would be open to lifestyle changes that can collectively reduce our impact. People who are unreceptive to these changes do not realize that these changes are necessary due to the our current position. If we fail to start making progress then our lifestyles are going to be forcibly changed by the environments we live in as we begin to see more of the consequences of global warming.

I think the single biggest obstacle in people making the 5 big changes Ken focuses on is selfishness. As Ken mentioned, I agree that most of these 5 changes are not really that difficult to make; however, many people do not make efforts because it is easier to just keep living life as they have. When people are comfortable, they don't like to "move". Some think to themselves: "What difference does it make if I make a change?" I have found myself in that position, but then I come to realize that anything helps, no matter how small. It is refreshing to take steps to be eco-friendly as an individual, but difficult for a collective of individuals to take these steps. Although I believe more and more individuals are taking it upon themselves to take action on being environmentally conscious, implementing plans like the Green New Deal I think are necessary immediately in order for the citizens of the United States to land a hard punch on the climate crisis. It is the responsibility for young people to vote for candidates that place combatting climate change as a top priority in order to make renewable energy mainstream in our homes and vehicles among other issues.


Although I understand people's reasons for disagreeing with smaller or communal living spaces, I find smaller or shared spaces to put me in a better mood. Watching tours of tiny houses or micro-apartments delights me because they are telling of how even with limited space, you can still have all the necessities you would have in a larger area. Being in a small space under certain conditions can feel cramped and uncomfortable, but if the design of the space is to your taste, it can feel cozy and charming. As a student who lives in a dorm with two roommates, I originally disliked the amount of space I had to myself and myself alone; but I soon realized my limited space didn't limit me from making my space feel like home.  By decorating my part of the room with my favorite things and organizing my drawers with the bare necessities, I felt happier in my dorm and realized living in a small space when I graduate would be a choice that would satisfy me emotionally because of its simplicity and its positive effect on the environment. Living more with less is real!

I totally agree with your point of selfishness. And I find it exciting to watch other people living happily in a limited space as well, just like you feel! So, what I want to add is that, for some groups of people, minimalism, or eco-friendly lifestyle just happen to fit them well, and from my perspective, a great deal of them are among the younger generation rather than the past. Thus, this appears to reaffirm the generational issue raised by Ken. Furthermore, Ken has mentioned some of the responses from his generation saying the 5 simple things to cut carbon footprint is a humiliation to American freedom. I understand that these things sound a little demanding for most of the American families, but those are not heir responsibilities! They still have their freedom to choose whatever they want. Therefore, what we are trying to call for is a spiritual transcendence, at least an active consciousness considering climate change and environmental issues.

I totally agree with you that selfishness is a huge reason why people do not participate in the 5 things that Ken suggested for mitigating climate change. However, I do think that it is extremely challenging for some people to make these changes, just for practical or financial reasons. Living in a big city may help with the transportation issue, but the reason lots of people commute to work is because they cannot afford to live in that big city. It is a little bit naive to suggest that people should just move there, when the cost of rent / housing there is often much more expensive than it other areas. (Of course I am not referring to all of the mansions mentioned in the video, just a standard size home that a family may have, in an area that requires commuting to work). Yes, biking to work is a great option for those who live in the city, but not practical for the majority of people on their longer way to work. Food is also a tricky subject, with some people only being able to afford cheap fast food, which of course makes their carbon footprint much larger than a plant based dieter. Seems kind of wrong to me to call them selfish for their dietary choices (or lack thereof).

As for the food waste, fast fashion, and excessive consumption, I cannot argue with that one. That does come down to selfishness and where people lay their priorities. The American mindset of deserving to have every single thing they want is not justified in my opinion. I think that people should have to make sacrifices in certain places where possible for the sake of our planet. Every person’s situation is different, so as long as they are making an attempt at some change, that to me is what counts. Someone who drives a lot of miles should be very conscious of the amount of food they waste or excess stuff they purchase. For me, there is nothing that anyone could really say to convince me not to fulfill my dream of having a big family one day with a lot of kids, so I’ll stick to my vegetarian diet and continue biking to get to where I have to go. The climate crisis may require radical change, but at least for every individual, as long as they are giving effort in some way, I give them credit.

Since the start of this class, I have been waiting to find out what ways specifically Ken recommends to reduce my carbon footprint. Decreasing the use of a car and transitioning into using a bike, walking or public transportation is luckily a huge part of my life now as a UCSB student. Additionally, the housing should not be a problem as I plan to live in a city after college. To continue, the knowledge that I have gained from this class has led me to switch my diet to a completely plant based diet for a few weeks now. As for the impact of clothing, I will try to shop more at thrift stores and am planning on using a new sustainable way to shop called Thred up. I think that the divide between how the generations address not only the issues that arise with climate change but the need to change one’s actions is clear. I can understand the difference between the way each generation feels about the idea of change due to different places that each generation is in their lives. We as the younger generation are yet to truly establish our lives and how we live, so when thinking about change it seems like a simple life change for us. Even though this is not the case for older generations, they still must act. This is not an excuse and actions should still be taken.

 I really agree with your take of the relation of change to selfishness. If one person was truly committed to change these small differences overtime would feel like nothing. Like Dante I have found myself questioning the power of one when I was faced with temptation to break my newly started vegan diet. However, I realized that my efforts, even if minor, mean more than giving into the impulse. I really stand by the idea of incorporating a carbon tax in order to push individuals that are not as inclined to make choices that are sustainable to do so. Once again similarly to Dante I really enjoy living in a smaller space. My dorm even as small as it is still feels like home and fits everything I need and more. Living in a communal space introduces me to new experiences that I would be unable to replicate living anywhere else.

I agree that the biggest obstacle facing those of the older and newer generations that is preventing change is that we are refusing to give up the lifestyle we have grown accustomed and become comfortable with. I know that for my grandparents the idea of getting rid of a meat diet and replacing it with a strictly plant based diet would be ridiculous. I think that as my generation is more open to the idea but that does not mean that we are changing. I know that most of the kids in my class are still aiming to have the mansions and most expensive possessions because that is what their parents and society told them will make them happy. So the only way to change this idea it to help society rethink life's value.

I think that the idea about community housing and the comparison to dorm is very true. Maybe at first people would be against the whole community living but the reality is that it is not the worst thing in the world. We all need to make small changes such as families buying homes with one less bedroom and one thousand less square feet. I also agree that people should think about helping support more public transportation and ways to decrease the need for the use of gas.

I agree with you. The five changes mentioned by Ken can be really helpful for alleviating the climate crisis, but as you have said, most people will not really do it as a result of selfishness. Less people will move out from their comfortable zone to a limited space area. This can be particularly challenging for the old generation because they have suffered from the era when there was not so many transportation tools and limited house conditions. The people from the old generation have spent all their life time to earn their cars, houses, and family, so there seems no point for them to abandon any single parts of their life just for making the world better. They believe that the loss of their house space and transportation will make them have less happiness than what they have right now. Fortunately, there are some a group of people like Ken who dedicate their lives on helping others realize what is happening on the planet. He has given us five things that we can do for alleviating the climate crisis, which will be really helpful if others can change their lifestyles based on Ken’s suggestions.
